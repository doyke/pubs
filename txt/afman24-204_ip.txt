SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision incorporates applicable changes to the Department of Transportation (DOT) Title
49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
Technical Instructions. This revision amends policy statements (Chapter 1-Chapter 3), general
packaging, hazard classification and communication information (Attachment 3- Attachment
4), and packaging requirements (Attachment 5- Attachment 13), and certification requirements
(Attachment 17). This manual integrates existing/new packagings paragraphs and reorganizes
text to comply with Air Force Manual format and changes many procedures. These changes
clarify requirements and further standardize DOD packaging and shipping with the commercial
sector.

     1.8.5. Packages bearing orientation arrow (―This Way Up‖) labels must be loaded, stowed
     and handled at all times according to label direction. Single packagings with end closures
     must be loaded and stowed with closures upward.
1.9. Protective Equipment. The base must ensure availability of protective equipment to cope
with ground emergencies involving the cargo during loading operations. Coordinate respiratory
and other personal protection requirements with the medical service. The aircraft operator will
ensure appropriate equipment is available to protect aircrew and passengers when transporting
materials whose vapors are toxic, irritating or corrosive. Aircraft must have a closed oxygen
system or protective mask for each person aboard. The shipper will provide any required special
equipment to meet unique cargo safety requirements. It is the shipper's responsibility, based on
intimate knowledge of the material, to determine necessary required protective equipment. While
the exact equipment required depends on the materials being transported, following are the
recommended minimum (or equivalent substitutions):
     1.9.1. Two pairs of rubber gloves.
     1.9.2. One pair of protective gloves.
     1.9.3. One plastic or rubber apron.

   1.10.1. Unitized loads will be as stable as a single container.
   1.10.2. Freight containers (e.g., Internal airlift and helicopter Slingable Unit (ISU),
   Container Express (CONEX), Military-Owned Demountable Container (MILVAN), etc.) are
   not considered the outer package or overpack for any item stowed inside. Items within freight
   containers must be packaged as prescribed in this manual. Since air movement subjects cargo
   to rapid acceleration and deceleration, the contents of freight containers must be adequately
   secured/restrained to prevent damage or breakage from shifting. Consider both horizontal and
   vertical movement when securing/restraining the contents.
   1.10.3. Mark and label individual packages within overpacks and freight containers
   according to this manual and Military Standard – 129 (MIL-STD-129), Military Marking for

   1.10.8. To the greatest extent possible, place packages on aircraft pallets (e.g., 463L) and
   within/on freight containers, vehicles, and trailers so that markings required by Attachment
   14 and labels required by Attachment 15 are visible.
       1.10.8.1. For like items with the same classification, only one of the required hazard
       label(s) must be applied and visible.
       1.10.8.2. For items with different hazard classifications, at least one package for each
       classification must be positioned so hazard label(s) are visible.
       1.10.8.3. When placement prevents hazard labels from being visible, refer to A15.1.
   1.10.9. The use of the overpack provision may be limited by requirements in Paragraph
   A17.2.3.2.
1.11. Accessibility. Do not ship hazardous material in freight containers that are not easily
accessible to the aircrew during flight. Physically stow hazardous materials next to the container
opening and position to allow access while on the aircraft. The aircrew must have visual and
physical access to all hazardous materials to mitigate any hazard posed by an in-flight incident. If
there is evidence of a leak, the crew-member can locate the hazard, determine the extent of the
risk, and take appropriate action to get the leak under control or declare an in-flight emergency.
Ensure air transportation personnel have access to the contents for inspection. Provide a key or
combination for locked, unescorted containers to the aircraft commander or designated
representative. Ship only the following hazardous materials in inaccessible containers or tactical
shelters when properly secured:

 14                                                  AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012


       Technical Order (T.O.). Waiver requests must be initiated by the user/owner (for
       example, Battlespace). The user/owner must complete a MFR detailing all the hazards
       that exist, or no longer exist based on determinations by EOD, other expert(s), and a
       review of the T.O. Ensure that owner/user addresses every part of the aircraft/UAV that is
       hazardous as listed in the T.O. which details aircraft/UAV preparation for shipment.
       Confirm that no leaks, fumes, or potential detonation hazards exist. EOD will inspect and
       identify in writing whether explosive material is present or has been cleared. It is
       incumbent on the requestor to ensure aircraft/UAVs are safe to move and experts have
       evaluated entire object. The Installation Transportation Officer (ITO) will then create a
       memo describing the hazards that must be certified, and address hazards not requiring
       certification. Technically capable personnel (user/ITO) will assess the packaging and
       ensure it will contain/hold the aircraft/UAV. Describe in detail how the item is packaged
       for air transport. (For example, This UAV is packed in an Aircraft Coffin (a case),
       weighing 3325 and total cube is 497. The case is considered airtight when it is closed,
       sealing the contents inside.) If it is determined hazard(s) exist but cannot be properly
       certified IAW the aircraft/UAV T.O., staff the memorandums to the servicing MAJCOM.
       The servicing MAJCOM will staff the waiver request to the MAJCOM with operational
       control of the transport aircraft. The ITO or Customs official will notify the DOD
       Customs Program Manager, USTRANSCOM J5J4-PT for clearance of the transport
       aircraft to its destination within the Continental United States (CONUS).
       2.3.4.2. Emergency rescue operations.

   investigations. Qualified personnel of those agencies responsible for the cargo must certify
   that all safety precautions have been taken to transport the materials safely. The shipper must
   ensure compliance with as many requirements of this manual as possible. This authorization
   is valid only for movement out of an austere environment. At the first secure in-route airfield,
   the cargo must be prepared according to this manual or paragraph 2.3.1.
2.4. DOT Special Permits. A DOT special permit is authority to deviate from the requirements
of 49 CFR Parts 100-199. Use special permits as authority for shipment by military controlled air
movement, if applicable. Follow all requirements of the permit.
   2.4.1. The shipping activity must provide a copy of the permit for each shipment. If the
   approval date on the permit has expired, but a renewal has been applied for, enter, "Renewal
   Requested, Current Special Permit Still Valid". Place this statement on the permit after
   verifying renewal request with the Service Focal Point.
   2.4.2. The permit must accompany the cargo in the Defense Transportation System.

Terms
A1—The maximum activity of special form radioactive material permitted in a type A package.
A2—The maximum activity of radioactive material, other than special form, low specific activity
radioactive material, and surface contaminated objects permitted in a type A package. These
values are either listed in A11.4 or may be derived using the procedure in A11.3.
Activity (Radioactivity)— The number of radioactive atoms that decay per unit time. The unit
of activity is the curie or bequerel. The amount of radioactivity that may be transported in
various types of packages and various types of vehicles.
Aerial Port of Debarkation (APOD)— Any airfield location where hazardous materials are
received by military controlled airlift whether by channel, SAAM, airdrop, exercise, or
deployment.
Aerial Port Of Embarkation (APOE)— Any airfield location where hazardous materials are
entered into the Defense Transportation System IAW DTR 4500.9-R, for movement by military
controlled airlift whether by channel, SAAM, airdrop, exercise, or deployment.
Aerosol—Any non-refillable receptacle containing a gas compressed, liquefied, or dissolved
under pressure, the sole purpose of which is to expel a nonpoisonous (other than a division 6.1
packing group III material) liquid, paste, or powder and fitted with a self-closing release device
allowing the contents to be effected as solid or liquid particles in suspension in a gas, as a foam,
paste, or powder, or in a liquid or gaseous state.
Article—A manufactured item, containing a hazardous material or substance, in a specific shape
or design which end use is dependent on the shape or design. The shape or design prevents loss
of hazardous contents during normal conditions of transport.

Atmospheric Pressure—Atmospheric pressure is 101.3kPa (14.7 psi).
Aviation Regulated Solid or Liquid—Any material which has a narcotic, noxious, or other
properties such that in the event of spillage or leakage on an aircraft, extreme annoyance or
discomfort could be caused to crew members so as to prevent the correct performance of
assigned duties.
Bag—A flexible packaging made of paper, plastic film textiles, woven material or other similar
materials.
Becquerel (Bq)—The unit of measure for the activity of a radioactive material. Because this is a
very small unit of measure (1 Bq = one atomic transformation per second), the standard is the
larger multiple terabecquerel (TBq). One TBq = one trillion Bq. Other multiples may also be
used (MBq, GBq). This unit of measure is used when measuring how radioactive the item is.
Biological Product—A virus, therapeutic serum, toxin, antitoxin, vaccine, blood, blood
component or derivative, allergenic product, or analogous product used in the prevention,
diagnosis, treatment, or cure of diseases in humans or animals. A biological product includes a
material manufactured and distributed in accordance with one of the following provisions:

Class 1 (Explosives)—Any substance or article (including a device) which is designed to
function by explosion (i.e., an extremely rapid release of gas and heat). Unless the substance or
article is otherwise classed in Table A4.1, the term "explosive" may also refer to an item that is
able to produce a chemical reaction within itself and is able to function in a similar manner even
if not designed to function by explosion. Explosives in Class 1 are divided into six divisions as
follows:
1. Division 1.1-Consists of explosives that have a mass explosion hazard. A mass explosion is
one which affects almost the entire load instantaneously.
2. Division 1.2-Consists of explosives that have a projection hazard but not a mass explosion
hazard. Additionally, there are three subdivisions (1.2.1, 1.2.2 and 1.2.3). Refer to DOD 6055.9-
STD, DOD Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards, for specific subdivision definitions.
3. Division 1.3-Consists of explosives that have a fire hazard and a minor blast hazard or a
minor projection hazard (or both), but not a mass explosion hazard.
4. Division 1.4-Consists of explosive devices that present a minor explosion hazard. The
explosive effects are largely confined to the package and no projection of fragments of
appreciable size or range is to be expected. An external fire must not cause virtually
instantaneous explosion of almost the entire contents of the package.
5. Division 1.5-Consists of very insensitive explosives. This division is comprised of substances
which have a mass explosion hazard but are so insensitive that there is very little probability of
initiation or of transition from burning to detonation under normal transportation conditions.
6. Division 1.6-Consists of extremely insensitive articles that do not have a mass explosion
hazard. This division is comprised of articles which contain only extremely insensitive
detonating substances and which demonstrate a negligible probability of accidental initiation or
propagation. The risk from these articles is limited to the explosion of a single article.
Class 2.1 (Flammable Gas)—Any material that is a gas (boiling point) at 20 degrees C (68
degrees F) or less and has a pressure of 101.3 kPa (14.7 psi), in addition to one of the following

  not apply to overpacks used only for air shipment consolidation. Use a leak-proof liner,
  plastic bag, or other equally efficient means of containment specified in packaging or closure
  instructions according to A3.1.2. Items drained and purged that are susceptible to leaking
  purging fluid (e.g. small fuel components) will also be contained in a liner to prevent leaking.
  A3.1.5. Ullage (Outage). Do not entirely fill containers designed to hold liquids. When
  filling packagings with liquid hazardous material, leave sufficient interior space (outage) to
  prevent leakage of contents or distortion of containers due to change of temperature during
  transportation, storage, and handling. For flammable liquids and other volatile liquids with a
  high coefficient of expansion, a minimum outage of 2 percent at 54 degrees C (130 degrees
  F), is required.
  A3.1.6. Closures. Packages and containers must be closed as specified in a test report,
  packaging instruction, or drawing except as identified in A28.2.2. When used, stoppers,
  corks, or other such friction-type closures must be held in place securely, tightly, and
  effectively. Each screw-type closure on any packaging/container (other than UN
  specification jerricans) containing a hazardous liquid must be secured with pressure-sensitive
  tape, self-shrinking plastic, wire, a device designed to prevent the cap from loosening
  (integral locking cap), or other positive means to prevent the closure from loosening due to
  vibration or substantial temperature change.
  A3.1.7. Air-Eligible Packaging Requirements.

     A3.1.7.1. Combination Packaging Pressure Standard. Inner packagings (including
     closures) used to retain a hazardous liquid or semi-solid in a combination packaging must
     be capable of withstanding (without leaking) an internal air gauge pressure of not less
     than 95 kPa (14 psi); or 75 kPa (11 psi) for Packing Group III liquids in Class 3 or Class
     6.1; or a pressure related to the vapor pressure of the liquid contained in the receptacle,
     whichever is greater. Repack or overpack liquid hazardous materials in containers that do
     not meet the internal hydraulic pressure standard, into UN certified specification
     containers that meet this requirement. Determine the pressure related to the vapor
     pressure of the liquid by one of the following methods:
         A3.1.7.1.1. The total gauge pressure measured in the receptacle (that is, the vapor
         pressure of the liquid and the partial pressure of the air, or other inert gases, less 100
         kPa (15 psi) at 55 degrees C (131 degrees F), multiplied by a safety factor of 1.5. The
         total gauge pressure is determined on the basis of a filling temperature of 15 degrees
         C (59 degrees F) and a degree of filling such that the receptacle is not liquid full at a
         temperature of 55 degrees C (131 degrees F).
         A3.1.7.1.2. Not less than 1.75 times the vapor pressure at 50 degrees C (122 degrees
         F) of the material to be transported minus 100 kPa (15 psi ) but with a minimum test
         pressure of 100 kPa (15 psi).
         A3.1.7.1.3. Not less than 1.5 times the vapor pressure at 55 degrees C (131 degrees
         F) of the material to be transported minus 100 kPa (15 psi ) but with a minimum test
         pressure of 100 kPa (15 psi).
     A3.1.7.2. Single and Composite Packaging Pressure Requirement. Single packagings
     containing liquid hazardous material must meet the hydraulic pressure test requirements
     of 49 CFR §178.605. A test pressure of not less than 250 kPa (36 psi) for liquids of PG I;
     80 kPa (12 psi) for PG III liquids in Class 3 or Class 6.1; and 100 kPa (15 psi) for all
     other liquids is required. If shipping liquid hazardous materials in containers that do not
     meet the internal hydraulic pressure requirement, repack or overpack into UN
     specification certified containers that do meet the requirement.
     A3.1.7.3. Overpacking Containers. Pack containers holding liquids that do not meet the
     pressure requirement for air transport into an outer container that does meet the
     requirement. Separate interior containers by absorbent cushioning material as required by
     Attachment 20. Do not overpack pressurized containers in sealed metal drums. See
     Attachment 14 and Attachment 15 for marking/labeling requirements and Table A17.1
     for certification instructions.
  A3.1.8. Indicators. Valves and indicators (with protective caps when required), which are
  necessary to ensure safe transportation, must be installed in the shipping container. Examples
  are relief valves (vacuum or pressure), humidity indicators, or leak indicators with adequate
  sensitivity to alert monitor or crew of imminent danger.
  A3.1.9. Packaging for certain Class/Divisions. A packaging containing a Packing Group III
  material with a primary or subsidiary risk of Class/Division 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.1, or 8 must meet
  Packing Group II performance level.
  A3.1.10. Inner Packaging. Pack, secure, and cushion inner packagings of combination
  packagings to prevent breakage or leakage and to control movement within the outer
AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012                                                               47


   container. When partial contents are removed, fill voids to ensure a tight pack. Cushioning
   material must not react dangerously with the contents of the inner packagings. Inner
   packagings are required as specified by the applicable packaging paragraph. If inner
   packagings are not required, the packaging paragraph will state that inner packagings are not
   necessary. See Attachment 20 for absorbent cushioning requirements.
   A3.1.11. Outside Package/Container. The package or container must be of such size that
   there is adequate space to affix all markings and labels in a manner required by this manual
   (Attachment 14 and Attachment 15). If necessary, use overpacks to provide adequate
   space.
   A3.1.12. Solids in a Liquid Single Packaging. A single or composite packaging which is
   tested and marked for liquid hazardous materials may be filled with a solid hazardous
   material to a gross mass, in kilograms, not exceeding the rated capacity of the packaging in
   liters, multiplied by the specific gravity marked on the packaging, or 1.2 if not marked. In
   addition:
       A3.1.12.1. A single or composite packaging which is tested and marked for PG I liquid
       hazardous materials may be filled with:
          A3.1.12.1.1. A PG II solid hazardous material to a gross mass, in kilograms, not
          exceeding the rated capacity of the packaging in liters, multiplied by 1.5, multiplied
          by the specific gravity marked on the packaging, or 1.2 if not marked; or
          A3.1.12.1.2. A PG III solid hazardous material to a gross mass, in kilograms, not
          exceeding the rated capacity of the packaging in liters, multiplied by 2.25, multiplied
          by the specific gravity marked on the packaging, or 1.2 if not marked.
       A3.1.12.2. A single or composite packaging which is tested and marked for PG II liquid
       hazardous materials may be filled with a PG III solid hazardous material to a gross mass,
       in kilograms, not exceeding the rated capacity of the packaging in liters, multiplied by
       1.5, multiplied by the specific gravity marked on the packaging, or 1.2 if not marked.
   A3.1.13. Quantity limits for UN specification Nonbulk Packagings. Unless otherwise
   specified, the maximum capacity of allowed in a UN Specification packaging is expressed in
   the following table.

   A3.1.14. Plastics Drums and Jerricans. The period of use permitted for the transport of a
   hazardous material in plastics drums and jerricans is five years from the date of manufacture
   of the receptacles except for re-usable containers which are marked with the minimum
   thickness of the packaging material according to 49 CFR §173.28.
   A3.1.15. Foreign Packaging. UN standard non-bulk packaging manufactured outside the
   United States may be shipped by military air provided packages are marked according to
   A14.2, when applicable, and all other requirements of this manual are complied with. Refer
   to A3.3.2.10. for shipping of foreign cylinders.
   A3.1.16. Empty Packagings, (articles, Fuel Tanks, Containers, Cylinders, Radioactive
   Packages and Nonhazardous Materials). Except as specified in this paragraph, empty
   packagings are not subject to any other requirements of this manual.
       A3.1.16.1. Empty Containers. Inspect packages that formerly contained a hazardous
       material covered by this manual to determine the presence or absence of hazardous
       material. If there is presence of hazardous material, purge the hazardous material or the
       package is regulated in the same manner as prescribed for the package when it was full.
       A container is considered empty if:
AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012                                                               49


        A3.1.16.1.1. A hazardous article has been removed from its container and there is no
        possibility of remaining residue (i.e., empty torpedo or missile containers).
        A3.1.16.1.2. The container has been purged of the hazardous material it previously
        contained. Note: When purging equipment/facilities are not present at a given
        location, items must be properly packaged and certified as hazardous materials.
     A3.1.16.2. Empty Cylinders. Compressed gas cylinders are empty if the pressure in the
     cylinder is less than 40 pounds per square inch absolute (psia) at 21 degrees C (70
     degrees F). Psia equals the gauge pressure plus atmospheric pressure (14.7 psi).
        A3.1.16.2.1. Before shipment, inspect empty cylinders for dents, bulges, oxidation
        pits, or other damage. Handle faulty cylinders as required by the latest DOT
        regulations   or   DLAI     4145.25/A700-68/NAVSUPINST           4440.128D/MCO
        10330.2D/AFMAN 23-227(I), Storage and Handling of Liquefied and Gaseous
        Compressed Gasses and Their Full and Empty Cylinders.
        A3.1.16.2.2. Tightly close valves of cylinders before offering for transportation. The
        requirements of A3.3.2.3. apply to the protection of the valves.
        A3.1.16.2.3. If the cylinder contains residue of the following material, ship regulated
        as full cylinders, regardless of psia, unless completely cleaned and purged of residue
        or vapors:
            A3.1.16.2.3.1. Ammonia, Anhydrous
            A3.1.16.2.3.2. Division 2.2 with a subsidiary risk (other than division 5.1)
            A3.1.16.2.3.3. Contains a flammable or poisonous material
     A3.1.16.3. Empty Radioactive Material Packaging. Empty the contents of the packaging
     as far as practical, and ensure the requirements of 49 CFR §173.428 are met.
     A3.1.16.4. Identifying Nonregulated Material, Containers or Cylinders. An item listed in
     Table A4.1 may not be regulated because it does not meet the definition of the hazard
     class. This includes containers or articles defined as empty according to this paragraph. In
     this situation, when the item is determined to be nonregulated, the shipper must alert the
     carrier by:
        A3.1.16.4.1. Annotating "NONHAZARDOUS" in the address block of the Military
        Shipment Label (MSL) and/or mark container ―Non-Regulated‖. In the absence of the
        MSL, the shipper will use an equivalent means of notification.
        A3.1.16.4.2. Ship the item as general cargo and a Shipper's Declaration for
        Dangerous Goods form is not required.
        A3.1.16.4.3. Apply an "EMPTY" label according to Attachment 15, when
        applicable. A label is not required for equipment or articles unless packaged, crated,
        or otherwise enclosed to prevent ready identification.
        A3.1.16.4.4. The "NONHAZARDOUS" entry on the MSL and the use of an
        "EMPTY" label is not required when the hazardous contents are completely removed
        from the container and there is no possibility of remaining residue, and the hazard
 50                                                 AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012


           communication markings and labels are removed or covered. Identify cylinders as
           empty as required by A15.3.4.
   A3.1.17. Hidden Hazardous Shipment Indicators. Shippers have not always properly
   identified all hazardous materials prior to entering the DTS. The main reason is lack of
   knowledge of hazardous materials located or packed in equipment, toolboxes, parts, etc.
   Personnel that ship, inspect or handle cargo in DTS should be aware of potential hidden
   hazards. If hazards are suspected, frustrate the shipment and coordinate with the shipping
   activity to resolve. The following table has examples of cargo that could contain hidden
   hazards that may endanger the safety of aircraft.

        normal transportation conditions.
        A3.3.7.4.2. Except as specifically required by a CAA, a package of radioactive
        materials may be carried among packaged general cargo without special stowage
        provisions, if:
            A3.3.7.4.2.1. The heat output in watts is not over 0.1 times the minimum package
            dimension in centimeters. 49 CFR §173.448
            A3.3.7.4.2.2. The average surface heat flux of the package is not over 15 watts
            per square meter (W/m2) and the immediately surrounding cargo is not in sacks or
            bags or otherwise in a form that would seriously impede air circulation for heat
            removal. 49 CFR §173.448
        A3.3.7.4.3. Aircraft in which radioactive materials have been spilled may not again
        be placed in service or routinely occupied until radiation dose rate at any accessible
        surface is less than 0.005 mSv/h (0.5 mrem/h) and there is no significant removable
        radioactive surface contamination as determined in A3.3.7.6. When contamination is
        present or suspected, segregate the package and any other materials it has touched as
        far as practical from personnel contact until needed radiological advice or assistance
        is obtained. For personnel safety, take care to avoid possible inhalation, ingestion, or
        contact with radioactive materials that may have leaked or spilled from its package.
        Leave any loose radioactive materials and associated packaging materials in a
        segregated area pending disposal instructions from responsible radiological
        authorities.

            A3.3.7.4.4.3. Any liquid pyrophoric radioactive materials.
AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012                                                              77


        A3.3.7.4.5. Do not transport exclusive use shipments of packages having a surface
        radiation level in excess of 2 mSv/h (200 mrem/h) except by special arrangement.
     A3.3.7.5. Stowage on Aircraft or Storage Incident to Transportation.
        A3.3.7.5.1. Do not ship radioactive Category II-Yellow or Category III-Yellow
        material on the same aircraft or store in any one area, such as a transit area, terminal
        building, storeroom, or assembly yard, if the sum of the critical safety indices in any
        individual group of packages exceeds 50. (49 CFR §173.447, 173.457, and §175.702)
        A3.3.7.5.2. If the total critical safety index for all packages, overpacks, or freight
        containers exceeds 50, separate the packages overpacks, or freight containers into
        groups. Store groups of these packages so as to maintain a spacing of at least 6 meters
        (20 feet) from each other group.
        A3.3.7.5.3. Ensure separation of Category II-Yellow or Category III-Yellow material
        from packages containing undeveloped film according to the distances shown in 49
        CFR §175.706.
        A3.3.7.5.4. Radioactive Category II-Yellow and Category III-Yellow material must
        be separated from persons or animals by a minimum of 2 pallet positions (176 inches)
        at all times while on the aircraft. If the total transport index of all packages on the
        aircraft exceeds 50, the separation distance between the surfaces of the radioactive
        materials packages and the surfaces bounding the space occupied by persons or
        animals must be at least 9 m (30 feet).
        A3.3.7.5.5. The maximum limits are as follows:
            A3.3.7.5.5.1. A maximum transport index of 10 per individual package.
            A3.3.7.5.5.2. A maximum critical safety index of 100 per aircraft.
            A3.3.7.5.5.3. A maximum transport index of 200 per aircraft.
     A3.3.7.6. Radioactive Contamination.
        A3.3.7.6.1. Contamination Control. Keep the level of nonfixed (removable)
        radioactive contamination on the external surfaces of each package offered for
        shipment as low as practical. The level of nonfixed radioactive contamination may be
        determined by wiping an area of 300 cm2 of the surface concerned with an absorbent
        material, using moderate pressure, and measuring the activity on the wiping material.
        Take sufficient measurements in the most appropriate locations to yield a
        representative assessment of the nonfixed contamination levels. The amount of
        radioactivity measured on any single wiping material divided by the surface area
        wiped and divided by the efficiency of the wipe procedure may not exceed the limits
        set forth in Table A3.4 at any time during transport. Other methods of assessment of
        equal or greater efficiency may be used.
        A3.3.7.6.2. Inspecting Aircraft for Contamination. Periodically check aircraft used to
        routinely transport radioactive materials for radioactive contamination. Determine
        frequency of the checks based on the likelihood of contamination and the extent to
        which radioactive materials are carried aboard the aircraft. An aircraft must be taken
        out of service if the radiation dose rate at any accessible surface is 0.005 mSv/h (0.5

          A3.3.7.7.1. Transport Index – Radiation Exposure Control.
              A3.3.7.7.1.1. The TI for a package, overpack, or freight container is the number
              derived using the following procedure:
                  A3.3.7.7.1.1.1. Determine the maximum radiation level at a distance of 1 m
                  from the external surfaces of the package, overpack, or freight container. If
                  the radiation level is determined in units of millisievert per hour (mSv/h), then
                  multiply the value by 100 to convert to units of millirem per hour (mrem/h). If
                  the radiation level is determined in units of millirem per hour, then the value
                  is not changed. For uranium and thorium ores and concentrates, the maximum
                  radiation dose rate at any point 1 m from the external surface of the load may
                  be taken as follows:
                    A3.3.7.7.1.1.1.1. For ores and physical concentrates of uranium and
                    thorium - 0.4 mSv/h (40 mrem/h).
                    A3.3.7.7.1.1.1.2. For chemical concentrates of thorium – 0.3 mSv/h (30
                    mrem/h).
                    A3.3.7.7.1.1.1.3. For chemical concentrates of uranium, other than uranium
                    hexafluoride – 0.02 mSv/h (2 mrem/h).
                  A3.3.7.7.1.1.2. For freight containers, the value determined in A3.3.7.7.1.1.1.
                  must be multiplied by the appropriate factor from Table A3.5.

                  A3.3.7.7.1.1.3. The figure obtained in A3.3.7.7.1.1.1 and A3.3.7.7.1.1.2 must
                  be rounded up to the first decimal place (e.g. 1.13 becomes 1.2), except that a
                  value of 0.05 or less may be considered as zero.
              A3.3.7.7.1.2. Transport Index – Consignment. The transport index for each
AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012                                                            79


           overpack or freight container must be determined as either the sum of the TIs of
           all the packages contained, or by direct measurement of radiation level, except in
           the case of non-rigid overpacks for which the transport index must be determined
           only as the sum of the TIs of all the packages.
        A3.3.7.7.2. Determination of Criticality Safety Index (CSI). The criticality Safety
        Index (CSI) for packages containing fissile material is determined in accordance with
        the instructions provided in 10 CFR Part 71. The CSI for an overpack, freight
        container, or consignment or consignment containing fissile material packages is the
        sum of the CSIs of all the fissile material packages contained within the overpack,
        freight container or consignment.
     A3.3.7.8. General Package Design Requirements.
        A3.3.7.8.1. The packaging for the transport of radioactive material must provide the
        following:
           A3.3.7.8.1.1. Containment to prevent contamination of people and the
           environment.
           A3.3.7.8.1.2. Protection from radiation. The type of packaging depends on the
           amount and type of radiation (alpha, beta, gamma, neutron).
           A3.3.7.8.1.3. Prevention of criticality in fissile material.
           A3.3.7.8.1.4. Protection from internal heat generation.
        A3.3.7.8.2. Design each package used for shipment of radioactive materials so that:
           A3.3.7.8.2.1. The package can be easily handled and properly secured during
           transport.
           A3.3.7.8.2.2. Each lifting attachment on the package, when used in the intended
           manner, with a minimum safety factor of three, does not impose an unsafe stress
           on the structure of the package. In addition, design the lifting attachment so that
           failure under excessive load does not impair the ability of the package to meet all
           other requirements of this attachment and Attachment 11. Remove, make
           inoperable for transport, or design with equivalent strength for lifting each
           attachment or other feature on the outer surface of the packaging that could be
           used to lift the package.
           A3.3.7.8.2.3. The external surface, as far as practical, may be easily
           decontaminated.
           A3.3.7.8.2.4. The outer layer of packaging avoids, as far as practicable, pockets
           or crevices where water might collect.
           A3.3.7.8.2.5. Each feature that is added to the package at the time of transport,
           and is not a part of the package, does not reduce the safety of the package.
           A3.3.7.8.2.6. The package will be capable of withstanding the effects of any
           acceleration, vibration, or vibration resonance that may occur during
           transportation without any deterioration in the effectiveness of any of the closing
           devices or in the integrity of the package and without loosening or unintentionally
80                                                  AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012


            releasing the nuts, bolts, or other securing devices.
            A3.3.7.8.2.7. The package will be capable of withstanding, without leakage, an
            internal pressure that produces a pressure differential of not less than the
            maximum normal operating pressure plus 95 kPa (14 psi).
            A3.3.7.8.2.8. The packaging materials and any components will be physically
            and chemically compatible with each other and the contents.
            A3.3.7.8.2.9. All valves through which the package contents could escape will be
            protected against unauthorized operation.
     A3.3.7.9. Additional Packaging Design Requirements for Type A and B Packages.
        A3.3.7.9.1. In addition to meeting the general design requirements each Type A
        packaging must also meet the design requirements of 49 CFR §173.412 and test
        requirements of 49 CFR §173.461 and §173.465.
        A3.3.7.9.2. Each type B(U) or type B(M) package must meet the design and test
        requirements of 10 CFR Part 71.
        A3.3.7.9.3. Each shipper of a DOT 7A package must maintain on file for at least 1
        year after the latest shipment complete documentation of tests and an engineering
        evaluation or comparative data showing that the construction methods, packaging
        design, and materials of construction comply with that specification. Unless otherwise
        required, the shipper is exempt from maintaining this documentation if it is
        maintained by the Inventory Control Point (national stock number managing activity).
     A3.3.7.10. Radiation Level and Thermal Limitations.
        A3.3.7.10.1. Design each package of radioactive materials so that:
            A3.3.7.10.1.1. The radiation level is not more than 2 mSv/h (200 mrem/h) at any
            point on the external surface of the package. 49 CFR §173.441
            A3.3.7.10.1.2. The transport index is not over 10. 49 CFR §173.441
        A3.3.7.10.2. Design, construct, and load each package of radioactive material so that:
            A3.3.7.10.2.1. The heat generated within the package due to the radioactive
            contents will not, at any time during transportation, affect the integrity of the
            package under normal transportation conditions.
            A3.3.7.10.2.2. The temperature of the accessible external surfaces of the loaded
            package will not, assuming still air in the shade at an ambient temperature of 38
            degrees C (100 degrees F), exceed either a temperature of 50 degrees C (122
            degrees F) in other than an exclusive use shipment or 85 degrees C (185 degrees
            F) in an exclusive use shipment.
     A3.3.7.11. Types of Packaging. The types of packages used for radioactive material
     which are subject to the activity limits and material restrictions defined in A11.3.,
     A11.5.8., A11.6.1., A11.7., and A11.10.1., and meet the corresponding requirements are
     as follows. Packages containing fissile material or uranium hexafluoride are subject to
     additional requirements (see A3.3.7.3.4. and A3.3.7.18).

        Mark the type of purging fluid used and the flash point on the outer container.
     A3.3.9.6. Dry Ice.
        A3.3.9.6.1. Properties of Carbon Dioxide, Solid. At temperatures above -78.5
        degrees C (-109.3 degrees F) dry ice will sublimate and release carbon dioxide fumes.
        If the carbon dioxide concentration in the aircraft is over 0.5 percent, crewmembers
        may suffer shortness of breath. Carbon dioxide concentrations of 3.0 percent are
        endurable from 1/2 to 1 hour. Concentrations of 5.0 percent are dangerous from 1/2 to
        1 hour and concentrations of 9.0 percent are fatal from 5 to 10 minutes. Carbon
        dioxide is heavier than air; therefore, the highest concentration is at or near floor
        level. Caution crewmembers against lying on the cargo compartment floor or
        remaining in the cargo compartment for a prolonged period. If symptoms of
        overexposure are noted, use oxygen and increased ventilation to provide rapid relief.
        A3.3.9.6.2. Seat passengers forward of and separate by the greatest distance possible
        (minimum one full pallet position) from dry ice.
        A3.3.9.6.3. Passenger and crewmembers will not occupy the same pallet position as
        dry ice.
        A3.3.9.6.4. Do not carry dry ice (exceeding passenger acceptable carry-on quantities
        specified in Attachment 22) in any upper deck compartment.
        A3.3.9.6.5. Vent the aircraft cargo compartment to the greatest extent possible
        allowed by the flight profile and environmental conditions.
        A3.3.9.6.6. Quantity limits specified in this paragraph apply to all personnel, other
        than aircrew members, who occupy the cargo compartment with dry ice. Aircrew
        members entering cargo compartments exceeding quantity limits specified in this
        paragraph must take precautions to prevent oxygen deprivation (i.e. oxygen masks).
        A3.3.9.6.7. Pressurized Aircraft. For pressurized aircraft, the amount of dry ice that
        can be safely shipped by air regardless of the type container used depends on the
        sublimation rate of the ice, the volume of the aircraft, and the number of air changes
        per hour. To minimize the sublimation rate, use insulated containers surrounded with
        insulating blankets and tarpaulin during shipment to the greatest extent possible. To
        determine the amount of dry ice that can be safely shipped by air, use the formula in
        Figure A3.6.
        A3.3.9.6.8. Aircraft on Minimum Air Changes. When aircraft is on minimum air
        changes per hour, safe loads are drastically reduced. When the aircraft is on the
AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012                                                               87


          ground longer than 45 minutes, recalculate the safe quantity using new numbers of air
          changes per hour. Maximum quantities are shown in Figure A3.7 and Figure A3.8.

Figure A3.6. Formula For Determining Dry Ice Limitations.




Figure A3.7. Dry Ice Limitations When Aircraft is on Minimum Air Changes.




Figure A3.8. Maximum Quantities for Dry Ice Aboard C-17 Aircraft.




NOTE: Above quantities are the maximum amounts for operating with no passengers in the
cargo compartment. Limitation with passengers in the cargo compartment is set at 1,040 pounds
(472 kilograms) for both high and normal flow.
          A3.3.9.6.9. Non-pressurized Aircraft. For non-pressurized aircraft, the amount of dry
          ice that can be safely shipped by air depends upon the sublimation rate and ventilation
          of the aircraft. To minimize the sublimation rate, use insulated containers surrounded
          with insulating blankets and tarpaulins. The aircraft must have maximum ventilation
 88                                                   AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012


           during the shipment. With unpressurized cargo compartment, the quantity of dry ice
           that can be transported is unlimited if the fumes are vented overboard the aircraft.
           Maximum quantities aboard a C-5 aircraft are shown in Figure A3.9.

Figure A3.9. Maximum Quantities for Dry Ice Aboard C-5 Aircraft.

  A4.2.2. Items Not Specifically Listed. If a material is not specifically listed in Table A4.1,
  determine the PSN by comparing the characteristics of the items with the definitions of the
  various hazard classes in this manual. Assign a "Not Otherwise Specified" (N.O.S.) name
  based on the hazard class of the material. Examples are: "FLAMMABLE LIQUID, N.O.S.;
  CORROSIVE SOLID, N.O.S." Attachment 1 contains hazardous class definitions.
  Determine the appropriate technical name according to A4.5.2.
  A4.2.3. Tentative PSN Assignment. A material for which the hazard class must be
  determined by testing, or a material that is a hazardous waste, the shipper may assign a
  tentative shipping name, based on:
     A4.2.3.1. The defining criteria of the hazard class.
     A4.2.3.2. The hazard precedence prescribed in A4.2.4.
     A4.2.3.3. The shipper's knowledge of the material.
     A4.2.3.4. A3.3.1.4. for new explosives.
     A4.2.3.5. If a N.O.S. PSN is assigned, a technical name is not required.
  A4.2.4. Precedence of Hazard. Assign any material specifically identified and listed in
  Table A4.1. the hazard class identified in column 3 of Table A4.1. Use other resources
  identified in A4.2.1. to determine the appropriate hazardous material description. If required,
  classify a hazardous material that is not specifically identified and listed in Table A4.1 (or is
  a mixture of materials), and meets the definition of more than one hazard, according to the
  following order of precedence:
     A4.2.4.1. Class 7 (Radioactive material, other than limited quantities). When limited
     quantities are involved the other hazardous properties take precedence.
     A4.2.4.2. Class 1 (explosives).
     A4.2.4.3. Class 2.3 (poisonous gas).
     A4.2.4.4. Class 2.1 (flammable gas). See also Class 9.
     A4.2.4.5. Class 2.2 (nonflammable gas). See also Class 9.
     A4.2.4.6. Class 5.2 (organic peroxide).
     A4.2.4.7. Class 6.2 (infectious substances or etiologic agents).
     A4.2.4.8. Class 4.1 (flammable solid). Only self-reactive substances and wetted
     explosives.
     A4.2.4.9. Class 4.2 (substances liable to spontaneous combustion). Only pyrophoric
     substances.
     A4.2.4.10. Class 6.1 (poisonous substances), PG I, poisonous by inhalation only.
     A4.2.4.11. Small quantities of compressed gas such as starter fluid (Class 2.1) or fire
     extinguisher (Class 2.2) installed on a vehicle do not take precedence over the flammable
     liquid (Class 3).
     A4.2.4.12. If required, classify other hazardous materials not identified above according
     to 49 CFR §173.2a.
AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012                                                                 93


   A4.2.5. Hazard Classification of Class 5.2 Organic Peroxides. Class 5.2 organic peroxides
   are categorized into one of seven "types" in a system of generic proper shipping names. The
   generic PSN for the organic peroxide describes the physical state of the material (i.e., liquid
   or solid), provides an indication of controlled temperature requirements, and includes the
   "type" of the organic peroxide. The seven types of organic peroxides are described in
   Attachment 1. Transport all Class 5.2 material under one of the generic proper shipping
   names listed in Table A4.1 beginning with the words "ORGANIC PEROXIDE". Technical
   names are listed below each PSN in lower case letters. To determine the correct PSN:
       A4.2.5.1. Find the technical name in Table A9.1 and select the UN identification
       number assigned to the technical name that best describes the item (in terms of
       concentration ranges, physical characteristics, etc.).
       A4.2.5.2. Turn to the "ORGANIC PEROXIDE" listed in Table A4.1. These entries
       constitute the "generic" organic peroxide proper shipping names.
       A4.2.5.3. Match the UN identification number for the technical name with a UN
       identification number associated with the generic PSN.
       A4.2.5.4. The generic PSN associated with organic peroxides will include the "type"
       under which the organic peroxide falls. Organic peroxide types are defined in
       Attachment 1.
   A4.2.6. Hazard Classification of Fissile Materials. Except as provided in A3.3.7.11. classify
   each package of fissile materials as fissile class I, II, or III. Determine the numerical values
   for package assignments as fissile class I, the transport indexes for fissile class II packages,
   and the conveyance limitations for fissile class III shipments according to 10 CFR Part 71.
       A4.2.6.1. Fissile Class I. Packages may be transported in unlimited numbers, and in any
       arrangement, and require no nuclear criticality safety controls during transportation. A
       transport index is not assigned to fissile class I packages for the purpose of nuclear
       criticality safety control, although, the external radiation levels may require a transport
       index number.
       A4.2.6.2. Fissile Class II. Packages may be transported together in any arrangement, but
       in numbers that are not over an aggregate transport index of 50. For the purposes of
       nuclear criticality safety control, individual packages may have a transport index of not
       less than 0.1 and not more than 10. However, the external radiation levels may require a
       higher transport index number. These shipments require no nuclear criticality safety
       control by the shipper during transportation.
       A4.2.6.3. Fissile Class III. Shipments of packages of fissile materials that do not meet
       the requirements of fissile class I or fissile class II and are controlled in transit as
       prescribed in Attachment 3 by appropriate arrangements between the shipper and the
       carrier.
A4.3. Determining Degree of Hazard (PG). For most material, the PG is assigned in column 5
of Table A4.1. Packing groups I, II, and III indicate the degree of hazard associated with the
materials and are used to identify the severity of UN specification performance tests associated
with the packaging for the item. Poisonous by inhalation material are assigned hazard zones (see
 94                                                   AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012


Attachment 1) in Table A4.1. If unknown, the PG or hazard zone may be determined according
to this paragraph. Class 2, and 7 do not have packing groups.
   A4.3.1. Class 2 Hazard Zone. The hazard zone of a Class 2.3 material is given in column 7
   of Table A4.1. When column 7 of Table A4.1 provides more than one hazard zone or is
   blank, determine the hazard zone from Figure A4.2. There are no hazard zones for Class 2.1
   and 2.2.

Figure A4.2. Determination of Hazard Zone for Class 2.3.




   A4.3.2. Class 3 Packing Groups. When Table A4.1 lists more than one PG for a material, or
   indicates that the PG is to be determined on the basis of the PG criteria for Class 3, determine
   the PG by using Figure A4.3. To use Figure A4.3, match the initial boiling point and flash
   point of the material to the corresponding PG. Flash points may be determined from the
   material safety data sheet, the Hazardous Material Information Resource System (HMIRS),
   the National Fire Protection Guide, or markings on the package. For example, a Class 3
   material with an initial boiling point of 38 degrees C (100 degrees F) and a flash point of 25
   degrees C (77 degrees F) would be assigned a PG III. If the initial boiling point is less than or
   equal to 35 degrees C (95 degrees F), assign PG I. Viscous Class 3 material (i.e., paints,
   varnishes, enamels, lacquers, adhesives, and polishes) in PG II with a flash point of less than
   23 degrees C (73 degrees F) may be grouped in PG III provided the requirements of 49 CFR
   §173.121(b) are met.

Figure A4.3. Criteria for Class 3 PG.




   A4.3.3. Class 4 Packing Groups. When Table A4.1 indicates that the PG of the material is to
   be determined on the basis of test criteria for Class 4 material, the test methods and
   appropriate criteria must comply with 49 CFR §173.125.
   A4.3.4. Class 5 Packing Groups. When column 5 of Table A4.1 is blank for a solid in Class
   5.1, determine the PG based on the test criteria found in 49 CFR §173.127. If column 5 is
AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012                                                              95


   blank for a liquid in Class 5.1, packing groups can be assigned by a comparison to existing
   entries in Table A4.1.
   A4.3.5. Class 6 Packing Groups and Hazard Zone. When Table A4.1., column 5 provides
   more than one PG and hazard zone for a specific Class 6.1 material, determine the PG and
   hazard zone by applying the following criteria:
      A4.3.5.1. Determine the PG assignment for other than inhalation of vapors by using
      Figure A4.4.
      A4.3.5.2. Determine the PG and hazard zone assignments for inhalation of vapors by
      using Figure A4.5.

Figure A4.4. PG Assignment For Other Than Inhalation of Vapors.




Figure A4.5. Inhalation Toxicity.




      A4.3.5.3. "V" is the saturated vapor concentration in air of the material in mL/m3 at 20
      degrees C (68 degrees F) and standard atmospheric pressure.
      A4.3.5.4. When the PG determined by Figure A4.4 and Figure A4.5 is different for two
      or more (oral, dermal, inhalation) requirements, the PG assigned to the material is the
      highest degree of toxicity identified.
      A4.3.5.5. Compute the PG and hazard zone for Class 6.1 mixtures that are poisonous
      (toxic) by inhalation as identified in 49 CFR §173.133 (b).
   A4.3.6. Class 8 Packing Groups. When Table A4.1. lists more than one PG for a material,
   determine the PG as follows:
      A4.3.6.1. Packing Group I. Substances that cause full thickness destruction of intact skin
      tissue within an observation period of up to 60 minutes starting after an exposure time of
      3 minutes or less.
 96                                                   AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012


       A4.3.6.2. Packing Group II. Substances that cause full thickness destruction of intact
       skin tissue within an observation period of up to 14 days starting after an exposure time
       of more than 3 minutes, but not more than 60 minutes.
       A4.3.6.3. Packing Group III. Substances are assigned to Packing Group III if they meet
       one of the following:
           A4.3.6.3.1. Substances that cause full thickness destruction of intact skin tissue
           within an observation period of up to 14 days starting after an exposure time of more
           than 60 minutes but less than 4 hours.
           A4.3.6.3.2. Substances which are judged not to cause full thickness destruction of
           intact skin tissue but which exhibit a corrosion rate on steel or aluminum surfaces
           exceeding 6.25 mm (1/4 inch) a year at a test temperature of 55 degrees C (130
           degrees F).
A4.4. Hazardous Substances. Table A4.3 identifies materials that are designated hazardous
substances under Section 101 (14) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). See Attachment 1 for a detailed definition of a
hazardous substance. Ensure review of Table A4.3 to determine if a material is a hazardous
substance.
   A4.4.1. Determine if the material is a hazardous substance by identifying the reportable
   quantity (RQ) in Table A4.3. The RQ is used to determine if material is a hazardous
   substance. The material is a hazardous substance if the amount in one package equal or
   exceeds the RQ quantity. Table A4.3 specifies, in pounds and kilograms, the minimum
   quantity of the material that constitutes an RQ. For example: sodium arsenate (RQ-1.0/0.454)
   means the RQ is 1.0 pound or 0.454 kilograms.
   A4.4.2. A substance or solution is a "hazardous substance" when the concentration by
   weight equals or exceeds the concentration listed in Figure A1.1.
   A4.4.3. If the technical name of the hazardous substance appears in Table A4.1, then the
   technical name is the PSN. If the hazardous substance does not appear in Table A4.1 and is
   not a forbidden material, select an appropriate generic (N.O.S.) PSN. Specify the technical
   name in parenthesis after the PSN. See Attachment 17 for certification requirements.
   A4.4.4. For Radionuclides, see 49 CFR §172.101, Appendix A.
A4.5. Using Table A4.1. Table A4.1. identifies "hazardous materials‖ for the purpose of
military air transportation. To use Table A4.1. locate the proper shipping name (PSN) of the
hazardous material and follow the information identified on the same line with the PSN. Use
Table A4.1. to identify the following: eligibility of material for shipment, identification number,
proper shipping name (PSN), hazard class and division, subsidiary risk, packing group (PG),
special provisions applicable to the material (including passenger eligibility), and packaging
paragraph.
   A4.5.1. Column 1: Symbols. Column 1 contains symbols that pertain to the PSN.
       A4.5.1.1. The letter "D" means that the PSN applies only to domestic shipments. These
       items are also identified by "NA" numbers in column 4. For international shipments,
       select an alternate PSN that is not preceded by a "D".
AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012                                                               97


     A4.5.1.2. The "" (star) identifies that a technical name is required in association with the
     PSN.
     A4.5.1.3. The ―+‖ (plus) fixes the proper shipping name, hazard class and packing group
     for that entry without regard to whether the material meets the definition of that class or
     packing group or meets any other hazard class definition.
  A4.5.2. Column 2: Identification Number. Column 2 lists the identification number assigned
  to each PSN.
     A4.5.2.1. Ship items classified with "UN" or "ID" (identification) numbers domestically
     or internationally.
     A4.5.2.2. Ship items classified with "NA" (North American) numbers domestically only,
     or to and from Canada or Mexico. Use of ―UN‖ numbers is preferred even for domestic
     shipment.
     A4.5.2.3. New or revised UN or NA numbers in 49 CFR Part 172, ICAO, or IATA are
     recognized for use with this manual.
  A4.5.3. Column 3: Proper Shipping Names (PSN). PSNs are listed alphabetically in all bold
  capital letters in Table A4.1. Use either singular or plural wording. New and revised PSNs in
  49 CFR Part 172, ICAO, or IATA are authorized PSNs under this manual, provided the
  packaging requirements do not change. Alternate accepted spelling may be used provided the
  correct associated UN/ID number is used (e.g., ―UN1350, SULFUR‖ vice ―UN1350,
  SULPHUR‖). A PSN modifier which appears as lower case italicized letters are descriptive
  words which may be used, but are not required as part of the PSN.
     A4.5.3.1. Technical or Chemical Group Names. Provide a technical or chemical group
     name in association with the PSN when required by an ―‖ in column 1.
         A4.5.3.1.1. Organic Peroxides. Use technical names listed below the appropriate
         generic PSN (in lower case letters) in Table A4.1. See A4.2.5. for PSN assignment
         based on technical name.
         A4.5.3.1.2. Mixtures and Solutions. If the hazardous material is a mixture or solution
         of two or more hazardous materials, enter the technical names of at least two
         components most contributing to the hazards of the mixture or solution in parentheses
         after the PSN.
     A4.5.3.2. The Word "OR" in Table A4.1. The word "or" in a sequence of PSNs means
     that PSNs in the sequence are synonymous. Therefore, use of any one of the PSNs in the
     series is appropriate. Select only one PSN in the series when classifying the shipment.
     For Class 1 material, use the PSN listed in the JHCS.
     A4.5.3.3. The Word "SEE" in Table A4.1. When one item references another item (by
     use of the word "see") and both names are in capital letters, use either name as the PSN.
     Forbidden designations and passenger restrictions applicable to the referenced entry also
     apply to the "see" entry.
     A4.5.3.4. The Words ―SOLUTION‖ or ―MIXTURE‖. A mixture or solution containing a
     hazardous material listed by name in Table A4.1 together with one or more materials not
98                                                  AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012


     subject to this manual must be identified by the PSN of the hazardous material. Add the
     qualifying word ―solution‖ or ―mixture‖ to the PSN. (See 49 CFR §172.101(c) (10))
     A4.5.3.5. Concentration Ranges. When a shipping name includes a concentration range
     as part of the shipping description, the actual concentration shipped (if it is in the range
     stated) may be used in place of the concentration range. For example, ship a hydrogen
     peroxide solution containing 30 percent peroxide as either "Hydrogen peroxide aqueous
     solution (with not less than 20 percent but not more than 40 percent hydrogen peroxide)"
     or "Hydrogen peroxide aqueous solution (with 30 percent hydrogen peroxide)."
     A4.5.3.6. Hazardous Wastes. The PSN for a hazardous material that is a hazardous waste
     must include the word "WASTE" preceding the name of the material (i.e., WASTE,
     ACETONE). Comply with all requirements of this manual identified for the hazardous
     material when shipped as waste.
  A4.5.4. Column 4: Hazard Class/Division. Column 4 contains:
     A4.5.4.1. Primary hazard class and division numbers. When this manual references
     hazard class, that includes any division number if appropriate. For Class 1 (explosives),
     the compatibility group is also given. See A4.2. for additional information on
     class/divisions.
     A4.5.4.2. Some items that contain explosive material may be assigned to a classification
     other than Class 1 by DOD explosives hazard classification approval authorities due to
     the predominant hazard (see A3.3.4.4). Compatibility group letters assigned to non-Class
     1 material do not apply to military air transportation.
  A4.5.5. Column 5: Subsidiary. Column 5 identifies the hazard class/division of any
  subsidiary risk posed by a material. Subsidiary risk may vary, depending on the applicable
  PG.
  A4.5.6. Column 6: Packing Group (PG). Column 6 specifies one or more packing groups
  assigned to each PSN and hazard class. Hazard classes 2, 7, and ORM-D do not have packing
  groups. See A4.3. for additional information on PG.
  A4.5.7. Column 7: Special Provisions. Column 7 specifies codes for special provisions that
  are applicable for each PSN, hazard class, and PG. Special provision codes may vary,
  depending on the PG. Requirements of the special provision codes are identified in Table
  A4.2. The codes reflect four categories: numeric codes, codes beginning with "A", codes
  beginning with "N", and codes beginning with a ―P‖.
     A4.5.7.1. Use codes beginning with a ―P‖ to determine passenger eligibility for transport
     with hazardous materials.
     A4.5.7.2. Use all other codes to determine packaging provisions, restrictions, and
     exceptions from requirements for particular quantities or forms of materials.
     A4.5.7.3. When an additional packaging requirement is prescribed, the requirement is
     mandatory.
  A4.5.8. Column 8: Packaging Paragraph. This column lists the applicable packaging
  paragraph. ―FORBIDDEN‖ items are also identified in this column. Do not transport
  "FORBIDDEN" items by military aircraft.
AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012                                                                                      99


         A4.5.8.1. Except when otherwise identified, prepare hazardous material shipments
         according to the specified packaging paragraph.
         A4.5.8.2. Packaging paragraphs in each attachment provide titles as a guide for PSNs
         covered by that paragraph. These titles are a guide only and are not all-inclusive.
         A4.5.8.3. If a packaging paragraph in Table A4.1 specifies packaging that is not
         applicable to the form of the material (i.e., the packaging specified is for a solid material
         and the material shipped is in liquid form) use the following guidance to select the
         appropriate paragraph:
              A4.5.8.3.1. Use either packaging paragraph A8.2 (liquids) or A8.3 (solids) as
              appropriate.
              A4.5.8.3.2. Use either packaging paragraph A9.5 (liquids) or A9.6 (solids) as
              appropriate.

identifies the inhalation hazard.
6 This material is poisonous by inhalation and must be described as an inhalation hazard.
7 An ammonia nitrate fertilizer is a fertilizer formulation, containing 90 percent or more
ammonium nitrate and no more than 0.2 percent organic combustible material which does not
meet the definition and criteria of a Class 1 material.
8 A hazardous substance that is not a hazardous waste may be shipped under the shipping
description "Other regulated substance, liquid or solid", as appropriate.
9 EPA in 40 CFR §761.60 and §761.65 prescribes packaging for certain PCBs for disposal and
storage.
11 Package material either as a liquid or solid, as appropriate, depending on its physical form at
55 degrees C (131 degrees F) at atmospheric pressure.
12 In concentrations greater than 40 percent, this material has strong oxidizing properties and is
capable of starting fires in contact with combustible materials. If applicable, a package
containing this material must comply with the subsidiary risk labeling requirements of
Attachment 15.
13 The words ―Inhalation Hazard‖ shall be entered on each shipping paper in association with
the shipping description.
14 Motor fuel anti-knock mixtures are mixtures of one or more organic lead mixtures (such as
tetraethyl lead, triethylmethyl lead, diethyldimethyl lead, ethyltrimethyl lead, and tetramethyl
lead) with one or more halogen compounds (such as ethylene dibromide and ethylene
dichloride), hydrocarbon solvents or other equally efficient stabilizers; or tetraethyl lead.
17 Aqueous solutions of hydrogen peroxide containing less than 8 percent hydrogen peroxide
are not subject to the requirements of this manual.
21 This material must be stabilized by appropriate means to prevent dangerous polymerization.
22 If the hazardous material is in dispersion in organic liquid, the organic liquid must have a
flash point above 50 degrees C (122 degrees F).
23 Classify this material as Class 4.1 only if it is packed so that the percentage of diluent will
not fall below that stated in the shipping description at any time during transport.
27 Sodium carbonate peroxyhydrate is considered nonhazardous.
30 Sulphur is not regulated if transported in a non-bulk packaging or if formed to a specific
shape (e.g., prills, granules, pellets, pastilles, or flakes).
31 Materials that have undergone sufficient heat treatment to render them nonhazardous are not
subject to the requirements of this manual.
33 Ammonium nitrites and mixtures of an inorganic nitrite with an ammonium salt are
prohibited.
36 The maximum net quantity per package is 5 L (1 gallon) or 5 kg (11 lbs.).
AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012                                                                  223


43 The nitrogen content of the nitrocellulose must not exceed 11.5 percent. Pack each single
filter sheet between sheets of glazed paper. Ensure the portion of glazed paper between the filter
sheets is not less than 65 percent, by mass. The membrane filters/paper arrangement must not be
liable to propagate a detonation.
44 The formulation must be prepared so that it remains homogenous and does not separate
during transport. Formulations with low nitrocellulose contents and neither showing dangerous
properties when tested for their ability to detonate, deflagrate or explode when heated under
defined confinement by the appropriate test methods and criteria in the UN Manual of Tests and
Criteria, nor classed as a Division 4.1 (flammable solid) when tested in accordance with the
procedures specified in 49 CFR §173.124 (chips, if necessary, crushed and sieved to a particle
size of less than 1.25 mm), are not subject to the requirements of this manual.
46 During transport, it must be protected from direct sunshine and stored (or kept) in a cool and
well-ventilated place, away from all sources of heat.
47 Mixtures of solids which are not subject to this subchapter and flammable liquids may be
transported under this entry without first applying the classification criteria of Division 4.1,
provided there is no free liquid visible at the time the material is loaded or at the time the
packaging or transport unit is closed. Each packaging must correspond to a design type that has
passed a leakproofness test at the Packing Group II level. Small inner packagings consisting of
sealed packets containing less than 10 mL of a Class 3 liquid in Packing Group II or III
absorbed onto a solid material are not subject to this subchapter provided there is no free liquid
in the packet.
48 Mixtures of solids which are not subject to this subchapter and toxic liquids may be
transported under this entry without first applying the classification criteria of Division 6.1,
provided there is no free liquid visible at the time the material is loaded or at the time the
packaging or transport unit is closed. Each packaging must correspond to a design type that has
passed a leakproofness test at the Packing Group II level. This entry may not be used for solids
containing a Packing Group I liquid.
49 Mixtures of solids which are not subject to this subchapter and corrosive liquids may be
transported under this entry without first applying the classification criteria of Class 8, provided
there is no free liquid visible at the time the material is loaded or at the time the packaging or
transport unit is closed. Each packaging must correspond to a design type that has passed a
leakproofness test at the Packing Group II level.
51 This description applies to items previously described as ―Toy propellant devices, Class C‖
and includes reloaded kits. Model rocket motors containing 30 grams or less propellant are
classed as Division 1.4S and items containing more than 30 grams of propellant but not more
than 62.5 grams of propellant are classed as Division 1.4C.
53 Packages of these materials must bear a subsidiary risk label, "EXPLOSIVE", unless
exempted by the DOT. A copy of the permit must accompany the shipment.
56 Ensure a means to interrupt and prevent detonation of the detonator from initiating the
detonating cord is installed between each electric detonator and the detonating cord ends of the
jet perforating guns.
60 An oxygen generator, chemical, that is shipped with its means of initiation attached must
incorporate at least two positive means of preventing unintentional actuation of the generator,

102 This article may be transported as Class 1.4D if all of the conditions specified in 49 CFR
§173.63(a) are met. Reclassification requires approval by a DOD Explosive Hazard
Classification Authority according to A3.3.1.4.
103 Detonators that will not mass detonate and undergo only limited propagation in the
shipping package may be assigned to Class 1.4B. Mass detonate means that more than 90
percent of the devices tested in a package explode practically simultaneously. Limited
propagation means that if one detonator near the center of a shipping package is exploded, the
aggregate weight of explosives, excluding ignition and delay charges, in this and all additional
detonators in the outer packaging that explode, may not exceed 25 g. Reclassification requires
approval by a DOD Explosive Hazard Classification Authority according to A3.3.1.4.
104 Detonators which meet the following conditions may be assigned to Class 1.4S: Each
detonator may contain no more than 1 g of explosive, excluding ignition and delay charges, and

                                         Attachment 5
                      CLASS 1--EXPLOSIVES AND AMMUNITION

A5.1. General Requirements. For military members, failure to obey the mandatory provisions
from paragraphs A5.2 through A5.27 and any provisions of mandatory subparagraph(s)
hereunder is a violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Civilian
employees who fail to obey the provisions from paragraph A5.2 through A5.27 and any
provisions of mandatory subparagraph(s) hereunder are subject to administrative disciplinary
action without regard to otherwise applicable criminal or civil sanctions. Personnel shall not
deviate from these provisions and must select the correct inner/intermediate packaging and outer
container as specified in each packaging paragraph. Not all packaging paragraphs are inclusive
and packaging is based on the category of explosive or ammunition as identified in each
paragraph or subparagraph. This attachment contains information concerning packaging and
general handling instructions for Class 1 material. See Attachment 3 for additional information
concerning Class 1 material.
A5.2. Unpackaged Explosives. Unless otherwise authorized in this manual, package all
explosives according to Attachment 5. Explosives may only be removed from their required
packaging to meet operational requirements of Chapter 3 under the following circumstances:
   A5.2.1. On airdrop parachute platforms configured according to TO 13C7/FM 10-500 series
   publications.
   A5.2.2. When stored in approved racks or containers, or secured in/on tactical equipment or
   vehicles as operational components according to technical orders or publications.
   A5.2.3. When secured/restrained in freight containers according to service drawings
   approved for air movement.
A5.3. Items requiring Special Approval. Ship according to a Special Approval (includes CAA
or COE) issued for the particular item. See paragraphs 2.5 and 2.6 for more information on
CAAs and COEs. Comply with the following handling instructions only when shipping items
containing a fuel that is corrosive or toxic.
   A5.3.1. Handling Instructions. Exercise extreme caution in handling this item. Keep well
   ventilated, away from sparks, fire hazards, and oxidizing materials. Vapors are toxic when
   inhaled. Liquid is corrosive. Fuel in presence of an oxidizer is self-igniting and highly
   reactive. Approved protective clothing, gloves, safety goggles, and a positive pressure
   breathing apparatus must be available during handling of this material.
   A5.3.2. Shipping Requirements. The following requirements apply:
       A5.3.2.1. Load containers having an installed indicator in such a manner as to provide
       access to the indicator during flight. Inspect the indicator before aircraft loading, after
       aircraft loading, at cruise altitude, during flight every hour or as required by the
       applicable technical manual, as cargo tiedown is inspected, and after landing. The normal
       color of the indicator is white or off-white. The color will change to yellow if inhibited
       red fuming nitric acid (IRFNA) leak occurs. The color will change to black if an amine
       fuel mixture (AFM) leak occurs. Changes are obvious and do not require technical escort
       personnel to monitor.

       A5.3.2.2. Containers that do not have an indicator installed must be preplanned under the
       same conditions as described in paragraph 2.8. The shipper must contact the carrier no
       less than 72 hours before movement. The shipper must also furnish the following:
       A5.3.2.3. Protective clothing, gloves, and a positive pressure breathing apparatus for all
       personnel aboard the aircraft (see also paragraph 1.9).
       A5.3.2.4. Fume-detecting equipment.
       A5.3.2.5. A qualified technical escort or courier with equipment to monitor the item for
       leaks and is prepared to take emergency in-flight action.
   A5.3.3. Emergency Procedures. When a leak is detected, either by observation of the
   indicator or by monitoring equipment:
       A5.3.3.1. Get personnel out of the cargo compartment.
       A5.3.3.2. Alert pilot and crew.

          CLASS 5--OXIDIZING MATERIALS AND ORGANIC PEROXIDES

A9.1. General Requirements. For military members, failure to obey the mandatory provisions
from paragraphs A9.3 through A9.10 and any provisions of mandatory subparagraph(s)
hereunder is a violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Civilian
employees who fail to obey the provisions from paragraph A9.3 through A9.10 and any
provisions of mandatory subparagraph(s) hereunder are subject to administrative disciplinary
action without regard to otherwise applicable criminal or civil sanctions. Personnel shall not
deviate from these provisions and fully comply with the inner/receptacle and outer container
selections as specified in each packaging paragraph. Not all packaging paragraphs are inclusive
and packaging selection is based on the type of oxidizing materials and organic peroxides
shipped. This attachment contains information concerning the packaging and general handling
instructions for Class 5.1 (oxidizing material) and Class 5.2 (organic peroxides). See
Attachment 3 for other details concerning Class 5 material.
A9.2. Organic Peroxides Table. The Organic Peroxides Table (refer to 49 CFR §173.225 or
appropriate international regulation) specifies, by technical name, the organic peroxides
authorized for transportation. An organic peroxide identified by technical name in the organic
peroxide table must comply with all of the applicable provisions of the table. An organic
peroxide not identified in the organic peroxide table by technical name or a new formulation of
identified organic peroxides requires written approval from the DOT according to 49 CFR
§173.128 before transportation.

Table A9.1. Organic Peroxides.
ORGANIC PEROXIDES              See 49 CFR §173.225, or appropriate international regulation
A9.3. Class 5.2 Organic Peroxides must be packaged as follows: With the exception of organic
peroxide samples, packaging requirements for packaging paragraphs does not specify Class 5.2
organic peroxides. Determine appropriate containers by using Table A4.1 generic proper
shipping names in conjunction with Table A9.2 or Table A9.3 Containers selected from Table
A9.2 or Table A9.3 must pass PG II performance tests and must be UN marked. Table A9.2
applies to liquid organic peroxides. Table A9.3 applies to solid organic peroxides. Use
paragraphs A9.3.1 through A9.3.6 to determine the packaging requirements for organic
peroxides.
   A9.3.1. Determine the applicable generic PSN.
   A9.3.2. Locate the packaging reference (table and item number) for the generic PSN in
   column 8 of Table A4.1. The technical name and associated table or item reference will be
   listed in lower case letters beneath the generic PSN entry. Select the table or item reference
   pertaining to the technical name, but use the generic PSN (with technical name in
   parenthesis) to certify the shipment. The item number is the last number in the packaging
   reference (i.e., Table A9.2.1. is Table A9.2, Item 1). Labels, special provisions, etc.,
   specified for the generic PSN also apply to the technical names listed beneath it.
   A9.3.3. Turn to Table A9.2 or Table A9.3 as specified by column 8 of Table A4.1.
 322                                                 AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012


   A9.3.4. Locate the quantity nearest to the quantity to be shipped. This number represents the
   maximum net quantity per package authorized. Lesser item numbers (quantities) may be used
   instead of the item number specified for the material. Quantities specified for greater item
   numbers will not be used. For example, if the packaging reference is Table A9.3.4, item
   number 4 of Table A9.3 represents the maximum net quantity of the material that can be
   shipped in one package. However, the lesser quantities listed for item numbers 1-3 could also
   be used; quantities listed for item numbers 5-8 could not be used for the material because the
   quantities exceed the maximum net quantity per package permitted for the material.
   A9.3.5. Go across the row that contains the quantity to be shipped to identify the appropriate
   container (including applicable notes). Any container fitting the general container description
   in the table may be used if it has been tested to a PG II (or PG I) performance level.
   A9.3.6. Column 8 of Table A4.1 specifies the packaging requirements (table and item
   number) for organic peroxides. Table A9.2 specifies the type of packagings and the
   maximum net quantity per package authorized for liquid organic peroxides. Table A9.3
   specifies the type of packaging and the maximum net quantity per package authorized for
   solid organic peroxides.

A9.4. Samples of Organic Peroxides must be packaged as follows: Samples of new organic
peroxides or new formulations of identified organic peroxides for which complete test data is not
available, and which are being transported for testing and evaluation, may be transported and
assigned a PSN for organic peroxide, type C. Data available to the person offering the material
for transportation must indicate that the sample would pose a threat no greater than that of an
organic peroxide, type B, and that the control temperature, if any, is sufficiently low to prevent
any dangerous decomposition and sufficiently high to prevent any dangerous phase separation.
Packaging requirements are as follows:
   A9.4.1. The sample must be packaged according to Table A9.2 or Table A9.3.
   A9.4.2. The maximum quantity must not exceed 10 kg (22 pounds) per shipment.

   application, placement, size, legibility, and durability requirements for marking.
   A14.1.3. To the greatest extent possible, place packages on aircraft pallets (e.g., 463L) and
   within vehicles/trailers so that markings required by this attachment and labels required by
   Attachment 15 are visible.
   A14.1.4. When an aircraft pallet or vehicle/trailer contains like items, at least one package
   must have required markings/labels visible. When placement on an aircraft pallet, on a
   vehicle/trailer or within a freight container prevents marking and labeling to be visible, use a
   marking board according to A14.3.12.
   A14.1.5. Use a marking board according to A14.3.12. to identify unpackaged large and
   robust Class 1 articles which are marked with a Proper Shipping Name authorized prior to 1
   January 1990.
A14.2. UN Packaging Specification Markings. UN specification markings are mandatory for all
packages of hazardous materials unless exempted by paragraph A3.1.1 or a separate approval.
A description of the codes and sequence of information contained in the UN specification
marking is identified in Table A14.1. A sample of how the UN specification markings look is in
Figure A14.1, Figure A14.2 and Figure A14.3.

Table A14.1. UN Specification Marking Codes and Sequence of Instruction.
       The symbol used to certify that the packaging complies with UN recommendations.
       For embossed metal packagings the capital "UN" can be applied as the symbol.
4G     This is a two to four position code.
       The first position indicates the type of packaging and will be one of the following
       numbers:
               1 = Drum
               2 = Wooden barrel
               3 = Jerrican
               4 = Box
               5 = Bag
               6 = Composite packaging
               7 = Pressure receptacle
AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012                                                                  397


       The second position indicates the type of material that the container is made of. For
       composite packagings, two capital letters (second and third positions) will be used to
       indicate the type of materials. The first letter indicates the material of the inner
       receptacle and the second letter indicates the material of the outer packaging. For
       combination packagings, only the code for the outer packaging will be used. The
       following letters indicate the type of materials:
               A = Steel (all types and surface treatments)
               B = Aluminum
               C = Natural wood
               D = Plywood
               F = Reconstituted wood
               G = Fiberboard
               H = Plastic materials
               L = Textile
               M = Paper, multi-wall
               N = Metal (other than steel or aluminum)
               P = Glass, porcelain, or stoneware
       The third position (fourth position for composite packagings) will be a number
       indicating the category of packaging within the same type (i.e., 1A1 [non-removable
       head steel drum], 1A2 [removable head steel drum], 6HG1 [plastic receptacle with
       outer fiber drum] 6HG2 [plastic receptacle with outer fiberboard box]). NOTE: 4A1,
       4A2, 4B1, and 4B2 are obsolete UN codes, but may continue to appear as part of the
       markings.

The following special codes may follow the packaging type code:
V      Special packaging meeting the tests specified in 49 CFR §178.601(g)(2).
W      Packaging of the same type as specified by the UN requirements, but not meeting the
       same general construction requirements. The transport of such packagings is subject
       to written approval from the competent authority. For approval see 49 CFR
       §178.601(h).
X1.4 Identified first is the PG the configuration has been successfully tested too. X is used
or     for PG I. Y is used for PG II. Z is used for PG III. Items of a lesser (less hazardous)
X15 PG may be packaged in a packaging that has been tested to a higher PG provided the
       requirements of the test report are complied with. For single packagings, the relative
       density, rounded off to the first decimal will follow the PG, for which the container
       has been tested. This may be omitted when the relative density does not exceed 1.2.
       For packagings intended to contain solids or inner packagings, the PG will be
       followed by the maximum gross weight, in kilograms, that the packaging
       configuration has been tested.

100     For single packagings intended to contain liquids, the next marking indicates the
or      maximum test pressure, in kPa, rounded down to the nearest 10 kPa which the
S       container was tested (hydraulic test). For packagings intended to contain solids or
        inner packagings, use the letter ―S.‖ For air shipment of packagings intended to
        contain inner packagings, see A3.1.7.1. Also, if the inner packaging is plastic ensure
        the requirements of A3.1.3. are met.
11      The last two digits of the year during which the packaging was manufactured.
        Packagings of types 1H1, 1H2, 3H1, and 3H2 must also be marked with the month of
        manufacture. The month of manufacture may be marked on the packaging in a
        different place than the UN specification packaging marking.
USA The country authorizing the allocation of the mark.
***     The symbol of the party responsible for ensuring that the UN requirements have been
        met. The symbol must be registered with the US DOT, Office of Hazardous Materials
        Transportation. In place of a symbol, the in-the-clear name of the party responsible
        for ensuring the UN requirements have been met can be used. The Department of
        Defense uses the symbol "DOD."
Reconditioned packagings must be marked to indicate they have been properly
reconditioned. This marking must be applied near the initial marking and must replace the
country and symbol of the party responsible for ensuring the UN requirements have been
met, or be in addition to the initial marking. After reconditioning a packaging, the
reconditioner must apply the following markings in sequence:
USA The country in which the reconditioning was conducted.
***     The name or registered symbol of the reconditioner.
93      The year the packaging was reconditioned.
R       Enter the letter "R."
L       Enter the letter "L" for every packaging successfully passing the leakproofness test.

                          LABELING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

A15.1. General Requirements. Unless otherwise specified in this manual, apply the appropriate
labels to the outer packaging of packages containing hazardous materials.
   A15.1.1. Use labels meeting the commercial color and specifications outlined in 49 CFR
   §172.411 through §172.450, ICAO, or IATA. Do not use labels that are easily confused by
   their use, shape, and color, with the standard labels prescribed.
   A15.1.2. Labels must be diamond-shaped with each side at least 10 cm (4 inches) long and
   have a solid line border 6.3 mm (0.25 inches) from the edge. ―UN3373‖ labels may be 5 cm
   (2 inches) long.
   A15.1.3. The hazard class and division number must be at least 6.3 mm (0.25 inches) and
   not greater than 12.7 mm (0.5 inches). The label text must be at least 7.6 mm (0.3 inches) and
   will be in capitalized Roman letters.
   A15.1.4. It is the shipping activity's responsibility to establish procedures to locally fund for
   and procure hazardous material labels and commercial forms.
   A15.1.5. Secondary hazards do not require labels.
   A15.1.6. Comply with paragraph 1.10.8 to ensure visibility of hazard labels during
   transportation. If hazard labels required by this attachment are not visible due to placement
   (located in the middle of an aircraft pallet, cargo bed covered by a tarp , within a freight
   container, etc), apply required labels to a marking board placed/attached to identify presence
   of each hazard classification.
A15.2. Hazard Labels.
   A15.2.1. Affix to the outer packaging or (overpack) a primary hazard label and a subsidiary
   risk label(s) (if required) based on the hazard classification/subsidiary risk provided in
   columns 4 and 5 of Table A4.1 unless exempted by A15.4. Include the hazard class or
   division number in the bottom corner of the label(s). Labels that do not have the class or
   division number preprinted may be stamped or overprinted with the appropriate hazard class/
   division number in the bottom corner of the label.
       A15.2.1.1. For explosives, include the division number and compatibility group letter.
       Ensure the compatibility group letter is a capitalized Roman letter.
       A15.2.1.2. For Division 5.1 oxidizers and Division 5.2 organic peroxides, include the
       division number in the bottom corner of the label.
   A15.2.2. Unless otherwise directed in this manual, attach labels to the part of the package
   bearing the PSN if package size is adequate. If package size is not adequate, use an overpack.
   Packages requiring a Radioactive Material label ("Category I-White", "Category II-Yellow"
   or "Category III-Yellow") will be labeled on opposite sides.
   A15.2.3. Do not place labels over any identifying data on the container. Remove or
   obliterate any irrelevant labeling already on the packaging.
 410                                                 AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012


   A15.2.4. When hazardous materials are placed in an overpack, the appropriate primary
   hazard label, subsidiary hazard label(s) and handling label(s) for each class must be applied
   to the outer package or container. If the primary hazard or subsidiary risk label(s) of another
   component of the overpack already adequately identifies a primary or subsidiary risk it is not
   necessary to apply an additional label.
   A15.2.5. When hazardous materials are palletized on a 463L or warehouse pallet, ensure the
   label is clearly visible.
   A15.2.6. Position hazardous cargo loaded in the back of a vehicle so the labels are clearly
   visible, or apply the labels for each hazard loaded in the back of the vehicle to a marker
   board that is clearly visible.
   A15.2.7. Label each Limited Quantity package for each dangerous good contained in the
   package.
   A15.2.8. Excepted Quantities do not require hazard labels. See A19.2.3 for package marking
   requirements.
   A15.2.9. Label hazardous waste with the appropriate hazard label and properly completed
   hazardous waste label.
   A15.2.10. For items shipped under the PSN "Dangerous Goods in Machinery" or
   "Dangerous Goods in Apparatus" apply Package Orientation (This Way Up) labels to
   opposite vertical sides when required to ensure liquid hazardous materials remain in their
   intended orientation. If machinery or apparatus contains a magnetized material apply both a
   Class 9 (Miscellaneous) and a "Magnetized Material" label.
   A15.2.11. A label(s) is not required for domestic shipments when use is exempted by a DOT
   special permit. For international shipments, the correct label(s) must be applied.
   A15.2.12. Do not apply hazard labels to a package containing material that is not regulated.
   A15.2.13. Labels required by this attachment for individual packages will be applied directly
   to stretch or shrink wrapping used or to a marking board (A14.3.12). Orientation labels are
   not required if stretch or shrink wrap prevents incorrect loading of packages/containers.
A15.3. Handling Labels.
   A15.3.1. Apply a "Cargo Aircraft Only" label on packaging (to include overpacks) not
   permitted on passenger aircraft as identified in column 7 of Table A4.1. Also apply to
   marking boards according to A15.1.6., when applicable, if label is not visible. The ―Cargo
   Aircraft Only‖ label conforming to the specifications in 49 CFR §172.448 on December 31,
   2008 may be used until January 1, 2013.
   A15.3.2. The "Cargo Aircraft Only" label is not required on cargo shipped according to
   A17.3 unless diverted as identified in A17.3.5.
   A15.3.3. Apply a "Magnetized Material" label on packages containing magnetized material.
   An additional Class 9 label is not required. Also apply to marking boards according to
   A15.1.6., when applicable, if label is not visible.
   A15.3.4. Apply an "Empty" label when the packaging meets the requirements of paragraph
   A3.1.16. Any container or cylinder shipped as empty must have the previously applied
AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012                                                               411


   hazard labels removed, obliterated, destroyed, or completely covered by the "EMPTY" label.
   New or reconditioned cylinders do not require an "Empty" label but must be marked or
   tagged to indicate they are empty.
   A15.3.5. Apply "Keep Away From Heat" label to each outside package containing self-
   reactive substances of Class/Division 4.1 or organic peroxides of Class/Division 5.2.
   A15.3.6. Labels required by 49 CFR, ICAO, or IATA may be affixed even if not required by
   this manual.
   A15.3.7. A marking board may be used in lieu of applying a handling label(s) directly to a
   freight container (see A14.3.12).
A15.4. Labeling Requirements Applicable to Hazard Classes.
   A15.4.1. Class 1. Explosives labels will be applied to the same side as the nomenclature
   markings if the Service approved SPI or drawing directs the PSN to be marked on the top of
   the shipping container. For unitized, containerized, or palletized loads of like items with the
   same hazard classification, division and compatibility group, only one of the required hazard
   label(s) must be applied and visible.
   A15.4.2. Class 2.
      A15.4.2.1. For packages containing oxygen, compressed; or oxygen, refrigerated liquid,
      a label with the word "OXYGEN" may be used in place of a label with the word
      "OXIDIZER," if the letter size and color are the same as those required for oxidizer.
      Alternatively, an "OXYGEN" label may be used in place of the "NONFLAMMABLE
      GAS" and "OXIDIZER" labels required in Table A4.1.
      A15.4.2.2. Recoil mechanisms or artillery gun mounts prepared and certified according
      to A6.5.13., must have a nonflammable compressed gas label applied to each exterior
      container. However, when shipped as an integral part of the complete weapon system, the
      nonflammable compressed gas label may be on the weapon or its exterior cover.
   A15.4.3. Class 3. All flammable liquids, whose vapor pressure (Reid test) is more than 110
   kPa (16 psi) at 38 degrees C (100 degrees F), must have a "white bung label," 76 x 127 mm
   (3 by 5 inches), affixed near the bung or closure of the container.
   A15.4.4. Class 4. A division 4.1 subsidiary hazard label is not required on a package bearing
   a division 4.2 label.
   A15.4.5. Class 6.
      A15.4.5.1. Label PG I or II material with either a "TOXIC" or "TOXIC INHALATION
      HAZARD" label as appropriate.
      A15.4.5.2. Label hazard zone A or B material with a "TOXIC INHALATION
      HAZARD" label.
      A15.4.5.3. Material classified as an infectious substance, that also meets the definition of
      a Class 2.3 toxic material or a radioactive material, must also be labeled with a "TOXIC
      GAS" (or INHALATION HAZARD) label or "RADIOACTIVE" label as appropriate.
      A15.4.5.4. Label all Category A infectious substance packagings with an "INFECTIOUS
      SUBSTANCE" label.
 412                                                  AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012


   A15.4.6. Class 7.
       A15.4.6.1. Hazard Label. Each package requiring a "RADIOACTIVE" label must have
       two of these labels affixed to opposite sides of the package. The proper label to affix to a
       package of radioactive material is based on the radiation level at the surface of the
       package and the transport index. The proper category of label is determined according to
       Table A15.1. The first step is to determine the maximum radiation level at a distance of 1
       meter from the external surfaces of the package, overpack or freight container, the value
       determined must be multiplied by 100. The final step is the figure obtained in step 1 must
       be rounded up to the first decimal place, except that a value of 0.05 or less may be
       considered as zero. Apply the highest category label required for any of the two
       determining conditions. Radioactive Category I-White is the lowest category and
       Category III-Yellow is the highest. For example: a package with a transport index of 0.8
       and a maximum surface radiation level of 0.6 mSv/h (60 mrem/h) must bear a Category
       III-Yellow label (see Table A15.1)

Table A15.1. Radioactive Label Requirements. (See Note 1).
                          Maximum Radiation Level at any Point on
Transport Index (TI)      the External Surface                        Label Category
0 (see Note 1)            Less than or equal to 0.005 mSv/h (0.5      I - White
                          mrem/h)
 More than 0 but not      More than 0.005 mSv/h (0.5 mrem/h) but less II - Yellow
 more than 1 (see Note    than or equal to 0.5 mSv/h (50 mrem/h)
 2)
 More than 1 but not       More than 0.5 mSv/h (50 mrem/h) but less        III - Yellow
 more than 10              than or equal to 2 mSv/h (200 mrem/h)
 More than 10              More than 2 mSv/h (200 mrem/h) but not          III – Yellow
 (see Note 3)              more than 10 mSv/h (1000 mrem/h)
NOTES:
1. The category of label must be shown in Key 17 of the Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous
Goods form and must also be applied to radioactive materials packages. Any package containing
a "highway route controlled quantity" must be labeled as radioactive Category III-Yellow.
2. If the measured TI is not greater than 0.05, the value quoted may be zero.
3. If the TI is greater than 10, the package or overpack must be transported by SAAM airlift
only (see Attachment 24)
       A15.4.6.2. Subsidiary Risk Label. Label each package containing a radioactive material
       that also meets the definition of one or more additional hazards, as required by this
       attachment for the radioactive material and for each additional hazard. For example, label
       solid nitrates of uranium or thorium, "RADIOACTIVE" and "OXIDIZER." Subsidiary
       risk labels are not required for an uncompressed gas that is non-flammable and non-toxic.
       A15.4.6.3. Label Marking. The contents, activity, and for Category II and III yellow
       labels, the transport index must be marked on the label. Additionally, the CSI must be
       marked on the CSI label. Enter the following information in the blank spaces by legible
       printing (manual or mechanical), using a durable weather resistant means of marking:
AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012                                                            413


       A15.4.6.3.1. Contents. Mark the contents as follows:
          A15.4.6.3.1.1. Except for LSA-I material, the symbol of the radionuclide as listed
          in Table A11.1. Symbols that conform to established radiation protection
          terminology are authorized, (i.e., 99Mo, 60Co, etc).
          A15.4.6.3.1.2. For mixtures of radionuclides, or for different individual
          radionuclides packed together in the same package, the most restrictive
          radionuclides must be listed to the extent that space on the line permits.
          A15.4.6.3.1.3. LSA (except LSA-1) or SCO must have the symbol of the
          radionuclide followed by ―LSA-II‖, ―LSA-III‖, ―SCO-I‖, ―SCO-II‖ as
          appropriate.
          A15.4.6.3.1.4. For LSA-I material, only ―LSA-I‖ is required to be marked.
       A15.4.6.3.2. Activity. Express units in appropriate international units of Becquerels
       (Bq) or Terabecquerels (TBq). The customary units, i.e., curies (Ci), millicuries
       (mCi), or microcuries (uCi) may be included in parenthesis following the
       international units. Abbreviations are authorized. For a fissile material, the weight in
       grams or kilograms of the fissile radioisotope also may be inserted.
       A15.4.6.3.3. Transport Index (TI). For Category II and Category III yellow labels
       only, the Transport Index must be marked in the box provided. It must be rounded up
       to one decimal place (see Attachment 1).
       A15.4.6.3.4. Criticality Safety Index (CSI).
          A15.4.6.3.4.1. The Criticality Safety Index label must be marked with the CSI as
          stated in the certificate of approval for special arrangement or the certificate of
          approval for the package design, issued by the NRC or the US Competent
          Authority, in the box provided.
          A15.4.6.3.4.2. For overpacks and freight containers, the CSI on the label is the
          sum of the criticality safety indexes of the individual packages in the freight
          container or overpack as stated in the certificate of approval for the package
          design issued by the NRC or the US Competent Authority.
       A15.4.6.3.5. Overpacks and Freight Containers. When one or more packages of
       radioactive material are placed within an overpack, the overpack must be labeled as
       prescribed in this paragraph except as follows:
          A15.4.6.3.5.1. The content entry on the label may state ―See Shipper‘s
          Declaration‖ in place of the names of the radionuclides unless each inside
          package contains the same radionuclide(s).
          A15.4.6.3.5.2. The activity entry on the label must be determined by adding
          together the number of becquerals of the radioactive materials packages contained
          in the overpack.
          A15.4.6.3.5.3. For an overpack, the TI must be determined by adding together the
          transport indexes of the radioactive materials packages contained in the overpack.
          For a rigid overpack, the TI may alternatively be determined by direct
          measurement as prescribed in this paragraph; however, it must be taken by the
414                                                  AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012


             person who initially offered the packages contained within the overpack for
             shipment.
             A15.4.6.3.5.4. The category of Class 7 label for the overpack must be determined
             from Table A15.1 using the TI derived from the requirements in this paragraph
             and the maximum surface radiation level on the surface of the overpack.
             A15.4.6.3.5.5. The category of the Class 7 label of the overpack and not that of
             any contained packages must be used in accordance with Table 1 of 49 CFR
             §172.504(e) to determine when the transport vehicle must be placarded.
  A15.4.7. Class 8.
      A15.4.7.1. Wet-cell batteries prepared and certified according to A12.4. must have
      "Package Orientation" labels indicating the upright position (top) of the container, if not
      already marked on the container as specified in A14.3.6.
      A15.4.7.2. Label Chemical or First Aid Kits prepared in accordance with A12.6. with the
      primary hazard label and any subsidiary risk labels applicable to each individual hazard
      within the kit.
      A15.4.7.3. Packages displaying a Class 8 label need not display a Division 6.1 subsidiary
      hazard label if the toxicity of the material is based solely on the corrosive destruction of
      tissue rather than systematic poisoning.
  A15.4.8. Class 9.
      A15.4.8.1. Vehicles and equipment do not require a label unless packaged, crated, or
      otherwise enclosed to prevent ready identification.

                                      AREA PLACARDING

A16.1. General Requirements. Placard the area surrounding aircraft transporting any hazardous
materials when parked according to Table A16.1 or Service directives. If Service directives do
not contain specific procedures for placarding, use the following guidance:
   A16.1.1. Use placards that meet the general design, size, and color specifications of 49 CFR
   §172.519.
   A16.1.2. For explosives, fire and chemical hazard symbols specified in DOD 6055.9-STD
   may be used in place of placards.
   A16.1.3. Conspicuously display placards at the front, rear, and both sides of the aircraft
   unless emergency response access is restricted. Then post placards at entry points.
   A16.1.4. Park aircraft transporting DOD Class 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 explosives and any material
   identified as Inhalation hazard zone A in a remote area. Placarding is still required for these
   materials when parked in a designated restricted, posted, and traffic controlled parking or
   loading and unloading area.
   A16.1.5. Park aircraft transporting all other types of hazardous materials in a placarded area.
   However, placarding is not required for these materials when parked in a designated
   restricted, posted, and traffic controlled parking or loading and unloading area.
A16.2. Responsibility for Placards.
   A16.2.1. Military hosts are responsible for placarding at military bases.
   A16.2.2. At nonmilitary airfields, the agency delivering cargo to the aircraft, or off loading
   cargo is responsible for making arrangements with the airport manager for identifying the
   cargo, isolating parking and loading, placarding, firefighting, and disaster response.
   Arrangements for using en route nonmilitary airfields is the responsibility of the activity
   having operational control of the aircraft.
   A16.2.3. It is the shipping activity's responsibility to establish procedures to locally procure
   and fund for hazardous material placards.
   A16.2.4. The nomenclature of the placards is shown in Table A16.1.

Class 1.1 and 1.2, use the Explosive 1.1 placard. Otherwise, placard for each hazard or comply
with note 3 below.
2. The aggregate gross weight is the total gross weight of the compatible packages comprising
the shipment or different shipments of the same classification.
3. For those hazard classes located in the lower portion of the table, placarding is not required if
the aggregate gross weight of the packages of those classes is less than 454 kg (1001 pounds). A
"DANGEROUS" placard may be used in place of the separate placards for two or more
categories of hazardous material found in the lower portion of the table. When 1000 kg (2205
pounds) or more of one category of material from the lower portion of the table is loaded, the
specific placard for that material is required, and a "DANGEROUS" placard may not be used to
represent that material.

                        CERTIFYING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

A17.1. Shipper's Certification. Unless specifically exempted in this manual, the shipping
activity must complete a shipper's certification according to this attachment for all military air
shipments of hazardous materials.
   A17.1.1. Certifying Official.
       A17.1.1.1. An individual qualified according to A25.3. must inspect the hazardous
       materials prior to accomplishing the Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods form.
       A17.1.1.2. When transportation personnel are required to certify an item that requires
       special preparation (munitions, engines, etc), the item specialist or preparing activity will
       provide documentation indicating that the item is prepared properly for air shipment.
       Develop local procedures to determine acceptable documentation.
   A17.1.2. Certification Reference. Certify hazardous materials to a packaging reference in
   this manual. Hazardous material may be certified to the ICAO, IATA, or Title 49 CFR under
   the following conditions:
       A17.1.2.1. Comply with all requirements of the certifying document.
       A17.1.2.2. Shipments must be certified to this manual if:
           A17.1.2.2.1. The passenger quantity limitations of the certifying document are
           exceeded.
           A17.1.2.2.2. The PSN in Table A4.1 has other than a ―P5‖ Special Provision Code.
           A17.1.2.2.3. The material is forbidden on a passenger aircraft by the certifying
           document.

A17.2. Shipper‘s Declaration for Dangerous Goods Certification.
   A17.2.1. Forms Required. Complete shipper's certification on the "Shipper's Declaration for
   Dangerous Goods" standard commercial form. Two styles of the commercial form may be
   used. One style is designed with the "Nature and Quantity of Dangerous Goods" section left
   open for continuous printing. The other style is designed in a columnar format with the
   "Nature and Quantity of Dangerous Goods" section blocked and formatted with headings
   specifying each key entry (Figure A17.1). It is the shipping activity's responsibility to
   establish procedures to locally procure and fund for the Shipper‘s Declaration for Dangerous
   Goods form.
418                                                  AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012


      A17.2.1.1. Obtain the form through the procurement system from commercial vendors
      specializing in hazardous material transportation supplies.
      A17.2.1.2. The form may be locally produced depending on local capabilities and
      economic feasibility.
      A17.2.1.3. The form must meet the format, size, and color specifications outlined in
      IATA, Section 8-Documentation.
  A17.2.2. Copies Required. Complete and sign at least three Shipper‘s Declaration for
  Dangerous Goods forms.
      A17.2.2.1. Attach one certification form to the copy of the manifest that is placed on the
      aircraft.
      A17.2.2.2. Attach one certification form to the originating station file manifest. Intransit
      or enroute terminals may reproduce (photocopy) the Shipper‘s Declaration for Dangerous
      Goods form for their station file if required.
      A17.2.2.3. Place one certification form in a waterproof envelope and attach to the
      number one piece of the shipment.
      A17.2.2.4. The three original forms used to offer hazardous material for military air
      transportation must have the vertical red hatch border and certifying official‘s signature.
      Carbon signatures are acceptable.
      A17.2.2.5. Additional copies may be forwarded with the shipment. Vertical red hatch
      border is not required for any additional copies.
  A17.2.3. Form Completion. Complete the Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods form
  either manually (hand printed), mechanically (typewriter), or digitally (computer). The form
  may be completed by a combination of manual, mechanical, and digital means, as required,
  providing all entries are clear and legible. However, when possible, the shipping activity
  should complete the form entirely manually, mechanically, or digitally. Incorrect
  punctuation, spelling (other than Proper Shipping Name), or entries that touch column
  separating lines on the form is not justification for frustrating hazardous cargo. Entries may
  be either in upper or lower case or combination.
      A17.2.3.1. Use Table A17.1 for detailed instructions on accomplishing the shipper‘s
      certification form for nonradioactive and radioactive shipments. Use Table A17.2 to
      determine if a Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods is required for radioactive
      shipments.
         A17.2.3.1.1. For forms with the "Nature and Quantity of Dangerous Goods" in
         columnar format, enter information in the appropriate column according to Table
         A17.1.
         A17.2.3.1.2. For forms with the "Nature and Quantity of Dangerous Goods" open for
         continuous printing, enter the basic description according to Table A17.1. Example:
         "UN2744, Cyclobutyl chloroformate, 6.1 (8,3), PG II."
         A17.2.3.1.3. For forms with the "Nature and Quantity of Dangerous Goods" open for
         continuous printing, use two oblique strokes, i.e. "//", to separate sequences of
AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012                                                                419


         information or place each sequence on a separate line. Separate information within a
         sequence with a comma. See Figure A17.1 to identify separation of each sequence.
     A17.2.3.2. Hazardous materials with different proper shipping names/UN numbers will
     not be shipped under the same transportation control number (TCN). Complete a
     Shipper‘s Declaration for Dangerous Goods according to this attachment to identify each
     proper shipping name/UN number identified by the TCN (see A17.4.2. and A17.3. for
     exceptions). A single Shipper‘s Declaration for Dangerous Goods will be used for
     multiple like items shipped under one TCN.
     A17.2.3.3. The certifying official may make pen and ink changes to any key. Someone
     other than the certifying official may make pen and ink changes to Keys 1 (only to the
     telephone number and not to the address), 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, and 19 without affecting the
     certification. Personnel making a change to any key must sign next to or above the
     change. Additional relevant information may be added to Key 19 by someone other than
     the certifying official, provided all copies reflect the additional information and they are
     signed. All entries must be durable, clear, and legible on all copies. Shipments may be
     frustrated if any entry on the form is not clear and legible. If the Shipper's Declaration for
     Dangerous Goods form is rejected, the correction must be accomplished as described in
     this paragraph or an entirely new form must be completed and presented to the shipping
     activity.
     A17.2.3.4. Leave blank any key that does not require an entry (i.e., Key 14 when there is
     no subsidiary risk).
     A17.2.3.5. If the Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods does not contain sufficient
     space in any one key to accommodate all of the required information, use an additional
     Shipper's Declaration as an extension page. Each page must show the page number and
     total number of pages (Key 4). All pages must have the vertical red hatch border.
  A17.2.4. Not Enough Copies or No Copies. In instances where there are not enough copies
  of the Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods, a certified "true copy" may be placed with
  the station file manifest. When making a true copy:
     A17.2.4.1. Annotate all the information verbatim from the original Shipper's Declaration
     for Dangerous Goods.
     A17.2.4.2. Use the information in the signature block from the original form and
     annotate it on the true copy, (i.e., John Doe, 2 Oct 11). On the reverse side of the form,
     type or clearly print the words "True Copy" and the name of the individual who is
     certifying the form to be a true copy. This official must sign the form in longhand above
     the typed or printed name. The individual preparing a "true copy" need not be qualified
     according to A25.3. to certify the Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods as a true
     copy.
  A17.2.5. Split Shipments. When a shipment is split according to procedures identified in
  DTR 4500.9-R.
     A17.2.5.1. Someone other than the certifying official may change key 5 and key 16 entry
     for number of packages only. The individual making the change must sign above it.
420                                                 AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012


      A17.2.5.2. All other entries in key 16 (i.e., type of packaging and net quantity) will only
      be changed by the certifying official.
      A17.2.5.3. Prepare a "true copy" according to A17.2.4. The original shipper‘s
      certification form will accompany the aircraft manifest with the first shipment. Attach a
      split shipment ―true copy‖ to aircraft manifest and station manifest for subsequent
      shipments. Each Shipper‘s Declaration must reflect the correct TCN and number of
      packages.
      A17.2.5.4. Enter statement, ―Shipment split at XXX (use Air terminal three letter code)
      IAW DTR 4500.9-R, Part II‖ on reverse side of all Shipper‘s Declaration forms.
  A17.2.6. Multiple Mode Shipments. Shipments certified to the ICAO, IATA, or 49 CFR that
  do not exceed the passenger quantity limitations of the certifying document may use the same
  Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods for both the commercial and military segments
  of air transport. Include any information required by A17.1.2. For shipments that exceed the
  passenger quantity limitations of the ICAO, IATA, or 49 CFR:
      A17.2.6.1. Complete a Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods according to the
      ICAO, IATA, or 49 CFR for the commercial segment and a separate Shipper's
      Declaration for Dangerous Goods according to this manual for the military segment.
      A17.2.6.2. Place copies of the Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods needed for
      subsequent movement in a waterproof envelope on the number one piece of the shipment.
      A17.2.6.3. DOD aerial port personnel will remove the copies of the Shipper's
      Declaration for Dangerous Goods from the waterproof envelope and obliterate the "cargo
      aircraft only" label if not required for military transport.
  A17.2.7. Classified Information. Follow DTR 4500.9-R, Part II, Chapter 205 and MIL-STD-
  129 for marking and documenting classified hazardous materials. If the information to be
  entered on the Shipper's Declaration is classified, the following procedures apply:
      A17.2.7.1. Complete the signed original in detail, including essential classified data, and
      attach to the manifest that is placed on the aircraft. Once the classified information is
      applied, the Shipper‘s Declaration for Dangerous Goods must carry the same
      classification as the highest classification of the entered information.
      A17.2.7.2. The manifest on the aircraft must carry the same classification as the
      classified information until the classified Shipper‘s Declaration for Dangerous Goods is
      detached and handled according to applicable security regulations.
      A17.2.7.3. Complete the station file copy in detail except for the classified information.
      Enter the following statement in ―Additional Handling Information‖ (Key 19): ―See

                                      COMPATIBILITY

A18.1. General Requirements. For military members, failure to obey the mandatory provisions
from paragraphs A18.2 through A18.4 and any provisions of mandatory subparagraph(s)
hereunder is a violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Civilian
employees who fail to obey the provisions from paragraph A18.2 through A18.4 and any
provisions of mandatory subparagraph(s) hereunder are subject to administrative disciplinary
action without regard to otherwise applicable criminal or civil sanctions. Personnel shall follow
specific segregation /compatibility and deviation instructions for movement of hazardous cargo
via military airlift. Packages containing hazardous materials that might react dangerously with
one another must not be loaded or transported in a position that would allow interaction between
the material in the event of leakage. Segregation requirements for hazardous material on military
aircraft identified in Table A18.1 and Table A18.2 must be used to determine segregation
requirements.
   A18.1.1. Table A18.1 details segregation requirements for all hazardous materials.
   A18.1.2. Table A18.2 specifies compatibility requirements for Class 1.
   A18.1.3. A18.4 specifies compatibility requirements for tactical and contingency operations
   under the authority of Chapter 3.
A18.2. Segregation Requirements for All Hazardous Materials. Table A18.1 indicates the
explosives and other hazardous materials that must not be loaded, transported, or stored together.
   A18.2.1. Only the primary hazard class or division are considered for segregation.
   Subsidiary-risks and secondary hazards will not be used to determine segregation
   requirements when using Table A18.1.
   A18.2.2. The absence of any hazard class or a blank space in the table indicates that no
   restrictions apply.
   A18.2.3. The letter "X" at an intersection of horizontal and vertical columns indicates that
   these articles must not be loaded, transported , or stored together. For example, in Table
   A18.1, Class 3 flammable liquids, must not be loaded, transported, or stored with Class 1.1.
   A18.2.4. The letter "O" at an intersection of horizontal and vertical columns indicates that
   these articles must not be loaded together unless separated by a 463L pallet position or not
   less than a distance of 2.2 m (88 inches) in all directions. For example, Class 8 corrosive
   liquids loaded on a 463L pallet, must not be transported with Class 4.1 flammable solids on
   an adjoining pallet. If loaded in a logistic rail mode (e.g., C-17), these items must be
   separated by 2.2 m (88 inches) and located on different pallets.
   A18.2.5. The "*" at an intersection of horizontal and vertical columns indicates that
   segregation among different Class 1 materials is identified in Table A18.2.
   A18.2.6. Be sure to check notes for compatibility.
A18.3. Segregation Requirements for Class 1 Materials. Table A18.2 identifies Class 1
materials that must not be loaded, transported, or stored together.
   A18.3.1. A blank space in the table indicates that no restrictions apply.
 442                                                AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012


   A18.3.2. The letter "X" at an intersection of horizontal and vertical columns shows that these
   articles must not be loaded or stored together. For example, do not load or store Class 1.2C
   with Class 1.2H.
   A18.3.3. Unless otherwise authorized, do not pack explosives in the same outer packaging
   with other articles. Explosives of the same compatibility group or authorized combination of
   compatibility groups but a different class number may be packed together, provided that the
   whole package is treated as though its entire contents were comprised of the lower class
   number (higher hazard). For example, treat a mixed package of Class 1.2D explosives and
   Class 1.4D explosives as Class 1.2D explosives. However, when Class 1.5D is packed
   together with Class 1.2D, treat the whole package as Class 1.1D (for compatibility).
   A18.3.4. Incompatible explosives may be packed together when approved according to TB
   700-2/ NAVORDINST 8020.8B/TO 11A-1-47/DLAR 8220.1, DOD Explosive Hazard
   Classification Procedures or paragraph 2.3.2.
   A18.3.5. Subsidiary-risks will not be used to determine compatibility requirements when
   using Table A18.2.
   A18.3.6. Be sure to check notes for compatibility.
A18.4. Chapter 3 Segregation/Compatibility. The requirements of Table A18.1 and Table
A18.2 may be deviated from when transporting cargo approved to be airlifted using provisions of
Chapter 3, consistent with operational requirements. Normally incompatible hazardous
materials may be transported on the same aircraft when separated to the maximum extent
possible. Compatibility waivers are not required. Use Chapter 3 segregation/compatibility, to
include complete round rigging, for exercises only when there is an intent to use or fire
explosives and ammunition. The following restrictions are mandatory:
   A18.4.1. Explosives in compatibility groups A, J, K, and L can only be shipped with
   material in compatibility group S and Class 9.
   A18.4.2. Fissile class III radioactive materials (Class 7) cannot be loaded, transported, or
   stored on the same aircraft with any other hazardous material.
   A18.4.3. Class 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 cannot be shipped with any Inhalation hazard zone A
   material .
   A18.4.4. Class 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 cannot be shipped with Class 6.1 poisonous liquids, PG I.
   A18.4.5. Cyanides or cyanide mixtures (Class 6.1) cannot be loaded, transported, or stored
   with any corrosive Class 8 material.

A18.5. Classification Codes and Compatibility Groups of Explosives. The classification code
for an explosive consists of the class number followed by the compatibility group letter.
Compatibility group letters are used to specify the controls required for transportation and
storage and to prevent the additional hazard that might occur if certain types of explosives are
transported or stored together. All explosives entering the Defense Transportation System must
be assigned a final or interim hazard classification according to A3.3.1.4. Compatibility groups
and classification codes for the various types of explosive substances and articles are identified
in Table A18.3. Compatibility groups assigned to non-class 1 items are used for permanent
storage and do not apply while item is in the Defense Transportation System.

NOTES:
1. Packing groups are not used for this hazard class.
2. For inner packaging, the quantity contained in each receptacle must not exceed a water
capacity of 30 ml. For outer packaging, the sum of the water capacities of all the inner packaging
must not exceed 1 L.
3. Applies only to organic peroxides when contained in a chemical kit or a first aid kit.
4. Class 8, UN1774, UN2794, UN2795, UN2800, UN2803, UN2809, UN3028 and UN3477 are
not permitted in excepted quantities.
5. For Class 9 material, if no PG is given in Table A4.1, PG II quantities must be used.
    A19.2.3. Inner Packaging. Each inner packaging must be plastic (with a minimum thickness
    of 0.2 mm), glass, earthenware, or metal. The inner packaging must not react with, or be
    decomposed by, the material contained therein.
    A19.2.4. Closures. Closures must be held securely, tightly, and effectively in place with
    tape, self-shrink plastic, wire, or other positive means.
450                                                  AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012


  A19.2.5. Liquids. Liquids must not completely fill inner packaging at a temperature of 55
  degrees C (130 degrees F).
  A19.2.6. Intermediate Packaging. Securely pack each inner packaging in an intermediate
  packaging with cushioning material. The intermediate packaging must completely contain
  the contents in case of breakage or leakage, regardless of packaging orientation. For liquid
  hazardous material, the intermediate packaging must contain sufficient absorbent cushioning
  material to absorb the entire contents of the inner packaging.
  A19.2.7. Outer Packaging. Securely pack the intermediate packaging in a strong, rigid, outer
  packaging (i.e., fiberboard, wood).
  A19.2.8. Overpacks. Overpacks may be used and may contain packages of nonhazardous
  material. All material in the same outer packaging and overpack must be compatible.
  A19.2.9. Dimensions of Outer Package. Two of three outside dimensions of the outer
  package must measure at least 100 mm (4 inches). If the outer package is in the shape of a
  cylinder, it must have a minimum height and diameter of 100 mm (4 inches) each.
  A19.2.10. Other Hazardous Materials and Materials in Excepted Quantities. A package
  containing hazardous material in excepted quantities must not contain other hazardous
  material that are regulated by this manual (requires a Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous
  Goods).
  A19.2.11. Different Materials in One Outer Packaging. When different hazardous materials
  are contained in one outer packaging, use the formula listed below to determine the quantities
  that can be included in one outer packaging. The quantities of different hazardous materials
  contained in each outer packaging must be such that "Q" is less than or equal to 1.0, "Q" is
  calculated using the formula: nl/Ml + n2/M2 + n3/M3 = Q (nl, n2, etc. is the actual net
  quantity of each different hazardous material. Ml, M2, etc. is the maximum net quantity
  permitted for the material and packing group in the outer packaging according to Table
  A19.1) For example:
      A19.2.11.1. There are 15 inner packages at 20 ml each of Class 3, PG II , and 5 inner
      packages at 30 ml each of Class 8, PG II in one outer packaging: 300 ml/500 ml + 150
      ml/500 ml = 0.6 + 0.3 = 0.9. The result is less than 1.0, so the material can be shipped in
      one outer packaging.
      A19.2.11.2. There are 5 inner packages at 30 ml each of Class 3, PG II, and 15 inner
      packages at 30 g each of Class 8, PG II in one outer packaging: 150 ml/500 ml + 450
      g/500 g = 0.3 + 0.9 = 1.2. The result is greater than 1.0, so the item cannot be shipped in
      one outer packaging.
  A19.2.12. Package Performance Tests. The complete package (inner plus outer packaging),
  must be capable of withstanding the test specified in A19.2.12.1. without breakage or leakage
  of the inner packaging and without significant reduction in effectiveness. Tests must be
  carried out on the packaging prepared as for transport. Inner receptacles must contain at least
  95 percent of their capacity for solids and 98 percent of their capacity for liquids. The
  material to be transported in the packaging may be replaced by another material, except
  where this would invalidate the results of the tests. When another material is substituted for a
  solid, the material must have the same physical characteristics (i.e., mass, grain size) as the
AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012                                                                 451


   material to be shipped. When another material is substituted in the drop test for liquids, its
   relative density (specific gravity) and viscosity shall be similar to the material to be shipped.
      A19.2.12.1. For packaging with six sides (i.e., fiberboard box), the following free drops
      onto a solid, unyielding, flat, and horizontal surface from 1.8 m (6 feet) is required. Each
      test may be performed on different but identical containers.
          A19.2.12.1.1. One drop flat on the bottom.
          A19.2.12.1.2. One drop flat on the top.
          A19.2.12.1.3. One drop flat on the long side.
          A19.2.12.1.4. One drop flat on the short side.
          A19.2.12.1.5. One drop on a corner at the junction of three intersecting edges.
      A19.2.12.2. For cylindrical packaging, the following free drops onto a solid, unyielding
      flat and horizontal surface from 1.8 m (6 feet) is required:
          A19.2.12.2.1. One drop diagonally on chime or circumferential seam edge.
          A19.2.12.2.2. One drop on the weakest part (i.e., a closure) not tested by the first
          drop.
      A19.2.12.3. A force applied to the top surface for a duration of 24 hours, equivalent to
      the weight of identical packages if stacked to a height of 3 m (10 feet), including the test
      sample.
   A19.2.13. Package Marking. Excepted quantities of hazardous materials packaged, marked,
   and otherwise offered and transported in accordance with this paragraph must be durably and
   legibly marked with the following marking:

                     ABSORBENT CUSHIONING REQUIREMENTS

A20.1. Absorbent Material General Requirements. For combination packagings, use cushioning
materials suitable for the absorption of liquid hazardous materials in the event of leakage from
the primary receptacle. Ensure cushioning materials used are satisfactory in all respects. Ensure
the material is not capable of reacting adversely with the contents of the package and is
noncombustible. Do not use asbestos. The following requirements apply to the use of absorbent
cushioning material for combination packagings containing liquid hazardous materials:
   A20.1.1. Each package containing a liquid in PG I must include sufficient cushioning
   material to absorb the entire contents of the inner containers.
   A20.1.2. Each package containing a liquid in PG II must include sufficient cushioning
   material to absorb the contents of any one inner container. If the inner containers vary in size,
   include sufficient cushioning material to absorb the contents of the inner receptacle
   containing the greatest quantity of liquid.
   A20.1.3. Absorbent cushioning material is not required for:
       A20.1.3.1. Paint in PG II
       A20.1.3.2. Liquids in PG III (if inner receptacles are other than glass or earthenware)
       A20.1.3.3. Consumer Commodities (if inner receptacles are other than glass or
       earthenware)
       A20.1.3.4. Materials authorized by A17.1.2 certified to and prepared per an IATA
       packaging instruction requiring a secondary means of maintaining inner packaging
       closures or a leakproof liner in lieu of absorbent materials.
   A20.1.4. When overpacking containers of liquids that do not meet pressure requirements
   into containers that meet the pressure requirement, use absorbent cushioning material as
   stipulated above.
   A20.1.5. When absorbent cushioning material is required and/or the outer packaging is not
   liquid-tight, use a means of containing the liquid in the event of leakage. Use a leak-proof
   liner, plastic bag, or other equally efficient means of containment specified in packaging or
   closure instructions according to A3.1.2. Thickness of liners and polyethylene bags will be as
   specified in test report.
   A20.1.6. When the outer packaging is not liquid-tight and absorbent cushioning material is
   not required , use a leak-proof liner, plastic bag, or other equally efficient means of
   containment. When securely closed polyethylene bags are used to contain the cushioning of
   the hazardous liquid, the bags must be of sufficient size to form a liner for the exterior
   container , or a bag for the interior container. Thickness of liners and polyethylene bags will
   be as specified in test report.
   A20.1.7. When overpacking individual packagings for consolidation that already meet air-
   eligibility requirements use enough cushioning material to secure and position the
   packagings against damage. The cushioning material, absorbent or nonabsorbent, must
   completely fill any void space in the container.
 456                                                 AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012


   A20.1.8. Absorbent cushioning material is not required for containers that have met the UN
   packaging specification test requirements (including the hydrostatic pressure test) as a single
   or composite packaging.
A20.2. Determining the Amount Required. Use Table A20.1 as a guide to determine the
amount of vermiculite or diatomaceous earth required for overpacking and cushioning liquid
hazardous materials. Other equivalent cushioning materials may be used to meet A20.1.
requirements.
   A20.2.1. The amounts identified in Table A20.1 are the minimum requirements. When exact
   quantities of cushioning materials are not found in Table A20.1, make an approximation
   based on quantities listed.
   A20.2.2. When placing cushioning materials into the container, consider settling of the
   cushioning materials during transportation. Use enough cushioning material to compensate
   for any settling that may occur.
   A20.2.3. When the applicable test report identifies an amount larger than Table A20.1, use
   the amount identified in the test report.

radioactive material (other than excepted quantities), the jettison criteria are as follows:
   A24.5.1. Must not be jettisoned over land.
AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012                                                               467


  A24.5.2. May not be jettisoned over water unless the cargo, in addition to size criteria,
  weighs at least 1.6 g/cm3 (100 lbs/ft3) to ensure sinking. Also, the cargo must be jettisoned at
  least 19.3 kilometers (12 miles) offshore, and preferably beyond a shelf, in water 100
  fathoms (600 feet) or more in depth. The aircraft commander is given a predeparture briefing
  on acceptable jettisoning locations based on the above criteria. When cargo is jettisoned to
  decrease weight, jettison all other cargo before hazardous cargo.
  A24.5.3. When cargo is leaking and is beyond control of the escort to repair or neutralize,
  the escort must inform the aircraft commander. The decision of jettisoning will rest with the
  aircraft commander. In this instance, the commander may jettison the cargo over water
  without regard to weight or depth criteria.
  A24.5.4. When the cargo weighs less than 1.6 g/cm3 (100 lb./ft3) or when size of cargo
  would not permit inflight jettisoning, model of aircraft selected for overwater missions must
  be based on two-engine performance from equal time point (ETP) to destination. Aircraft
  performance is based on aircraft remaining airborne when all cargo except the hazardous
  cargo is jettisoned.

   known or determined by examination of the cylinder. Measure the cylinder‘s height from the
   external base to the valve seat. Measure the external diameter (width). Assume the cylinder
   does not cone at the top.
       A26.5.1.1. Example 1. Tank measurements:
Height: 50 inches
AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012                                                    475


Diameter: 9 inches
Radius: 4.5 inches
Tank contents: CO2
Internal Pressure: 900 psi
Tank Volume = 1.841 Ft3
P (pounds of gas) = 0.00512 x A x B x C = {0.00512 in2/Ft3} x {900 psi} x {1.841 Ft3} x
{1.516}
Answer: P = 12.9 pounds
       A26.5.1.2. Example 2. Tank measurements:
Height: 40 inches
Diameter: 12 inches
Radius = 6 inches
Tank contents: C2H2
Internal Pressure: 500 psi
Tank Volume = 2.618 Ft3
P (pounds of gas) = 0.00512 x A x B x C = {0.00512 in2/Ft3} x {500 psi} x {2.618 Ft3} x
{0.897}
Answer: P = 6.01 pounds
       A26.5.1.3. Example 3. Tank measurements:

P = 0.0001744 x A x B x C = 0.0001744 x (500 psi) x (2.618 Ft3) x (26.00)
Answer: P = 5.94 pounds
   A26.5.2. Examples for Determining Radioactive Shipments. A1/A2 values represent the
   maximum activity that can be shipped in a Type A package. A1 is for Special form material
   and A2 values is for Normal or Other form material. In dealing with mixtures of
   radionuclides if the sum of the ratios is <1, then use a Type A package. If the sum of the
   ratios is >1, then use a Type B package.
       A26.5.2.1. Example 1. Determine the most appropriate packaging when shipping a
       mixture of 0.46 TBq of Bromine-77 (Br-77) & 0.25 TBq of Cerium-143 (Ce-143).
Activity you have / Activity allowed = sum of the ratio
0.46 TBq/3 TBq = 0.15 (A2 for Br-77)
0.25 TBq/0.6 TBq = 0.42 (A2 for Ce-143)
0.15 + 0.42 = 0.57    Total sum of the ratios 0.57 < 1, so a Type A package is required
       A26.5.2.2. Example 2. Determine if the item can be shipped as a RQ of a hazardous
       substance.
Shipping a mixture of 2.02 TBq of Silver-112 (Ag-112), 0.16 TBq of Tin-113 (Sn-113) & 0.21
TBq of Tungsten-185 (W-185).
Activity you have / Reportable Quantity = RQ
2.02 TBq/3.7 TBq = 0.546 (RQ for Ag-112)
0.16 TBq/0.37 TBq = 0.432 (RQ for Sn-113)
0.21 TBq/0.37 TBq = 0.568 (RQ for W-185)
Total RQ of 1.576 > 1 Therefore, mixture would be regulated as a hazardous substance.
       A26.5.2.3. Example 3. Determine the most appropriate packaging when shipping the
       following:
1.45 TBq of Terbium-160 (Tb-160)
A2 value for Tb-160 is 0. 6 TBq.
1.45 TBq > 0.6 TBq Since the amount you are shipping is greater than the A2 value; a Type B
package is required.


       A26.5.2.4. Example 4. Determine the most appropriate packaging when shipping the
       following:
0.45 GBq of solid Niobium (Nb-95) internationally
0.45 GBq converted is 0.00045 TBq
A2 value for Nb-95 = 1 TBq
AFMAN 24-204_IP 3 DECEMBER 2012                                                            477


10-3A2 = 0.001 TBq > 0.00045 TBq
          A26.5.2.4.1. Since the maximum activity allowed is greater than amount being
          shipped, the item can be shipped in an Excepted package.
A26.6. Properties of Common Gases. Figure A26.6 is a list of the molecular weight and
specific gravity of common gases.

Figure A26.6. Properties of Common Gases.




A26.7. Lithium Content. Rechargeable lithium batteries are manufactured without lithium
metals. There are two methods to determine equivalent lithium content.
   A26.7.1. The rated capacity, in ampere-hours, of each cell times 0.3 expressed in grams (g).
   Example: A battery with 9 cells each having a rated capacity of 2.2 ampere-hours contains
   5.94 grams of equivalent lithium content (2.2 X 0.3 X 9 = 5.94g)
   A26.7.2. Dividing the stated volts (V) on a battery pack by 3.7 (rounded to nearest whole
   number), multiplying the results by the stated ampere-hours (Ah) times 0.3. Example:
   Battery marked with 14.8 (V) and 4.8 (Ah) contains 5.76 grams of equivalent lithium content
   (14.8 divided by 3.7 = 4, 4 X 4.8 = 19.2, 19.2 X 0.3 = 5.76 grams)

                               INSPECTION PROCEDURES

A28.1. Inspection General Requirements. Inspect hazardous materials before entering into the
military airlift system. The inspection will ensure hazardous materials are properly prepared and
documented. Follow the guidelines in this attachment when inspecting hazardous materials,
including opening an external container to inspect the internal packagings.
   A28.1.1. Originating Shipping Activities. This activity must prevent entry of improper
   shipments into the transportation system. Establish a quality control program that ensures
   packing, marking, labeling, and certifying of hazardous materials comply with this manual
   and safety of airlift criteria.
       A28.1.1.1. Inspect each package to ensure the packaging is correct and in good
       condition.
       A28.1.1.2. Open exterior containers if there is physical evidence to support suspected
       damage of the inner receptacles or if the external markings do not correspond to the type
       of container. Reseal opened containers according to the applicable test report or SPI.
       A28.1.1.3. Provide graduated dip-stick with any vehicle or wheel engine-powered SE
       without an operational fuel gauge containing fuel-in-tank. Not required if the item is
       drained and purged or drained to 500 ml (17 ounces) or less of residual fuel.
       A28.1.1.4. Check shipper's certification for overall accuracy including correct packaging
       paragraph.
       A28.1.1.5. Immediately remove damaged or improperly prepared packages from the
       transportation system.
       A28.1.1.6. Periodically inspect cylinders or spheres to ensure they have been retested
       and marked as required by 49 CFR Part 180, Subpart C and DLAI 4145.25/AR 700-
       68/NAVSUPINST 4440.128/MCO 10330.2B/ AFMAN 23-227_IP, Storage and
       Handling of Compressed Gases and Cylinders. Do not offer for transportation any
       cylinder or sphere not meeting this requirement.
   A28.1.2. Inspectors Other Than Originating Shipping Activity. Establish an inspection
   program at each Aerial Port of Embarkation to prevent improperly prepared hazardous
   material from entering the transportation system.
       A28.1.2.1. As a minimum, visually inspect all exterior containers and equipment for
       damage or leakage. Reject packages showing evidence of leakage (moisture or staining)
       or other suspected damage until corrective action is taken to make sure the item is safe
       for air shipment (see paragraph 1.7).
       A28.1.2.2. Remove improperly prepared or damaged containers from the transportation
       system and advise the shipper to immediately coordinate corrective action. Properly store
       suspect packages containing explosive material pending repair or disposition.
       A28.1.2.3. Use accurate fuel gauges, graduated dip-sticks or other positive means to
       determine the amount of fuel-in-tank for vehicles and equipment. If positive means is not
       available, drain and refill fuel tank to appropriate level in the presence of an inspector.

       key 6 of the Shipper's Declaration form. The "Inspector" cannot be the same individual
       who completes the Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods and signs Key 22.
       A28.1.2.6. Do not violate compatibility requirements (Attachment 18) in the
       consolidation or makeup of cargo loads.
       A28.1.2.7. Prepare SF 364, Report of Discrepancy, according to DLAI 4140.55/AR 735-
       11-2/ SECNAVINST 4355.18A/AFJMAN 23-215 (or equivalent reporting means as
       designated by the Service Focal Points and coordinated with HQ AMC) for any
       deficiencies discovered.
       A28.1.2.8. The Contingency Response Group (CRG), Departure Airfield Control Group
       (DACG), or Contingency Response Element/Team (CRE/CRT) or Cargo Deployment
       Function (CDF) provides qualified inspectors for the mobility movement inspection
       function during tactical or contingency deployments, redeployments, and exercises (see
       paragraph 1.2.6).
       A28.1.2.9. Figure A28.1 is an example of inspection record format.
A28.2. Inspection Packaging Procedures. Design inspection procedures to validate safety of the
shipment. Do not physically damage the package or perform any function that adversely affects
the integrity or original performance capability of the packaging.
