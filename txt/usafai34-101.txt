                             USAF ACADEMY, COLORADO

       This LICENSE is hereby made by and between ___________________
                                                      (Name of Licensee)

hereinafter called “Licensee” and the Federal Government of the United States of America,
hereinafter called “Government.”

       Whereas, the Licensee has been granted a license by the installation commander to
lawfully enter the installation for the purpose of bagging and carryout grocery services at the
United States Air Force Academy Commissary, it is mutually agreed between the parties as
follows:

1. Government consents to the Licensee performing bagging and carryout services of the
groceries purchased by Commissary patrons who desire Licensee’s service.

2. Licensee expressly acknowledges that he/she is not an employee of the Government or the
Defense Commissary Agency for any purposes and further acknowledges that he/she is not under
the supervision, direction, or control of any employee of Government. Licensee may not incur
any obligations in the Government’s name for any reason. Licensee has no authority to enter
into contracts or agreements on behalf of Government. The LICENSE does not constitute an
offer of employment, a partnership, a contract subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations, or
any other type of joint venture between the parties.

3. Government shall not pay, directly or indirectly, Licensee for performance of bagging and
carryout services for Commissary patrons. Licensee agrees to perform any and all bagging and
carryout services directly for Commissary patrons on a voluntary “as asked” basis in exchange
for any monetary tips or contributions which the Commissary patrons may provide to the
Licensee. Any payments received by Licensee from Commissary patrons are on a per job basis.

4. Licensee is not restricted in any way from providing bagging and carryout services to others,
including other grocery stores, supermarkets, or any other types of establishments located on or
off the military installation, which allow the use of bagging and carryout services. Licensee
expressly acknowledges that Licensee may perform similar services to the general public without
interference by the Government.

5. Government shall not be liable to Licensee for any business, travel, or other expense paid or
incurred by Licensee in rendering services under this LICENSE. Licensee shall supply, at
Licensee’s sole expense, any clothing, smocks, hats, name tags, etc. used to identify the bagging
and carryout service for Commissary patrons.

6. Because Licensee is engaged in a privately owned independent bagging and carryout service
business, Licensee is not eligible for, and shall not participate in any employer pension, health,
or fringe benefit plan, of the Government. No workers’ compensation shall be obtained by the
Government concerning Licensee. Licensee shall comply with the workers’ compensation law
concerning Licensee to the extent such law is applicable.

7. Neither federal, nor state, nor local income tax nor payroll tax of any kind shall be withheld or
paid by Government on behalf of Licensee. Licensee shall not be treated as an employee with

injury of any kind or nature whatever to all persons, whether employees of the Government, or

this LICENSE, including that resulting from the use of government furnished equipment.
Licensee agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Government, its agents, servants and
employees from and against any and all loss, expense, including attorney’s fees, damage or
injury growing out of or resulting from or occurring in connection with the execution of the work
herein provided for the Government and Commissary patrons.

9. Licensee agrees to make proper payment for groceries which have been damaged or lost
through the fault of the Licensee, as determined by the Head Bagger. Licensee shall follow the
following bagging procedures to minimize damage to breakable, delicate, or perishable items:

       g. Unless the customer requests otherwise, single plastic or paper bags are of sufficient
       quality to avoid the need for double bagging.

     the actual method used to avoid damaging Commissary customers’ purchases will be
     determined by him/her or the Head Bagger.

not use profane, abusive, or offensive language, will not destroy, damage, or abuse government

carryout service and shall comply with all installation security requirements.
