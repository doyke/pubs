1. Travis AFB Precious Metals Recovery Program Responsibilities.
     1.1. 60 LRS/LGRMI is appointed the Installation PMRP Manager. The Installation PMRP
     manager is the focal point for all PMRP matters at Travis AFB. Unit Commanders will
     appoint a PMRP monitor within each activity that uses precious metals in any form,
     generates precious metals bearing scrap or waste, or uses silver recovery equipment. All
     levels of supervision will make sure there is a clear line of communication and response to
     recommendations of the Installation PMRP manager and unit monitors.
2. Installation PMRP Manager (60 LRS/LGRMI) will:
     2.1. Represent the base in the day-to-day planning, organizing, directing, and controlling of
     the PMRP and perform or ensure performance of the duties listed in AFMAN 23-110,
     Volume 6, Chapter 4, paragraphs 4.2.2 through 4.2.15
     2.2. Keep a current list of PMRP monitors and precious metals generating/using activities.
     This list will also have the site (building number), organization/shop code of the activity,
     type of recovery equipment used, kinds of precious metals bearing scrap or waste generated,
     and other forms of precious metals used. If large volumes of precious metals are generated,
     coordinate with the resource protection program manager for storage requirements.
     2.3. Prepare a schedule for and visit each generating/using activity every 24 months for
     review of operations, documentation, and adherence to overall program policies and conduct
     program management training for unit monitors.
        2.3.1. Prepare and maintain a report of findings.
        2.3.2. Send copies of the report of findings to the 60 AMW/CC, 60 MSG/CC, and 60
        MXG/CC.
     2.4. Keep a file of precious metals generating/using activities' Operating Instructions (OIs),
     self-inspection checklists, and any other records needed to effectively manage the program.
     2.5. Maintain a record of refined precious metals that are GFM.
     2.6. Check the adequacy of methods used by the base activities to comply with HQ USAF,
     HQ AMC, and base directives on the PMRP.
     2.7. Check the adequacy of identification, safeguarding, and disposal of precious metals in
     the base inventory.
     2.8. Send a list of precious metals producing/using activities to the Integrated Defense

   Disposition Services to keep abreast of silver recovery techniques and to obtain or give
   assistance on the overall PMRP.
3. All Precious Metals Generating/Using Organizations will:
   3.1. Initiate and maintain a self-inspection program to include items such as security
   requirements, testing hypo fluids, receipt, issue, and turn-in procedural requirements. Ensure
   checklists show the peculiarities of each precious metals generating/using activity. Update
   checklists to show the results of the findings and recommendations of annual inspections.
   3.2. Provide the integrated materiel managers (IMMs) with results of laboratory tests
   (positive or negative) conducted on items to determine presence of precious metals. This
   will ensure assignment of the correct Precious Metals Indicator Code I of the Federal
   Cataloging System (Attachment 2).
4. Unit Commanders will:
   4.1. Appoint in writing unit PMRP monitors (primary and alternate) to receipt, issue and
   store precious metals. Units are required to provide a copy of the appointment letter
   containing the names, ranks, office symbols, and phone numbers to 60 LRS/LGRMI.
   4.2. Appoint in writing a disinterested person (one who does not operate the equipment or
   harvest the precious metal) to witness the harvesting of precious metals and to certify weight
   annotated on the disposal turn-in document, DD Form 1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt
   Document.
5. Unit Monitors will:
   5.1. Will advise the Installation PMRP Manager, 60 LRS/LGRMI, immediately in writing of
   any changes to the unit’s precious metal program. The monitors (primary or alternate) will
   accompany the Installation PMRP Manager on the 24month surveys.
   5.2. Maintain a record of precious metals.
   5.3. Maintain a record of precious metals bearing items generated and turned in to DLA
   Disposition Services.

   turned in to DLA Disposition Services.
      5.4.1. Account for all silver recovery cartridges under a debit/credit system of
      accounting. Most recovery cartridges have serial numbers. Use this number on all
      transaction documents when receiving and/or transferring these cartridges from activity
      to activity.
      5.4.2. When a cartridge does not have a serial number at the time of receipt, the number
      assigned will consist of the activity’s functional code, followed by the Julian date, and
      will be sequenced starting with 0001 for the first cartridge.
   5.5. Issue Operational Instructions (OI) to show all PMRP instructions. Write and revise OIs
   on the basis of HQ USAF and HQ AMC guidance, and from the Installation PRMP Manager.
 4                                                            TRAVISAFBI23-109 20 MAY 2013


     In addition, revise OIs on the basis of experience gained in audits and annual inspections, and
     of new developments in precious metals recovery technology. As a minimum OIs will:
        5.5.1. List the specific duties required to handle and account for precious metals in their
        inventory.

11. Requisitioning and Use of Refined Precious Metals.
     11.1. Precious metals recovered by this program are refined, stored and managed by DSCP.
     They are available for use on approved internal AF programs for use as GFM on production
     and maintenance contractors. They are available for just the cost of recovery plus an
     authorized administrative surcharge and transportation charge. These combined costs are
     much less than the open market price of the metal.
     11.2. Activities initiating purchase requests for precious metals or for repair of items, where
     precious metals can be furnished as GFM, will contact the Installation PMRP Manager
     located in 60 LRS/LGRMI. The Installation PMRP Manager will coordinate with DSCP to
     determine availability.
     11.3. Requisitioning activities will coordinate any correspondence between base activities
     and DSCP with the Installation PMRP Manager. For further guidance, see AFMAN 23-110,
     Volume 6, Chapter 4.
