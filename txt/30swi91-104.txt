1. Background Summary. The Western Range embraces a geographical area extending from
the west coast of the United States to 90 degrees longitude in the Indian Ocean. Within these
boundaries, 30 SW conducts polar orbiting, ballistic missile and aeronautical operations. The
launch and ballistic reentry or recovery phases use airspace and ocean areas that can also be used
by other aviation or maritime interests. Operation Hazard Notices provide real and constructive
notice to the domestic and international aviation and maritime communities of the time and
location of the hazards created by missile operations.
2. Responsibilities:
     2.1. The 30 SW Commander is assigned the responsibility for ensuring that flight safety
     criteria are consistent with operational requirements for all test activities supported by the
     Western Range.
     2.2. The 30 SW Safety Office (30 SW/SE) has been delegated by the Commander the
     authority to ensure that all necessary safety precautions are implemented and requirements
     are met.
     2.3. The 2nd Range Operations Squadron (2 ROPS) ensures hazard notifications are
     disseminated to appropriate agencies prior to activation of an operation.
3. Operational Requirements:
     3.1. Launch Safety (30 SW/SEL) will:
        3.1.1. Identify airspace and surface area hazard coordinate requirements to Airspace and
        Offshore Management Section (2 ROPS/DON).

   3.3. Range Scheduling (2 ROPS/DOS) will:
      3.3.1. Write and issue HYDROPACs, Broadcast Notice to Mariners and ALTRV
      APREQ from which Central Altitude Reservation Facility (CARF) will issue the
      appropriate notice to airmen (NOTAM). (Airfield closures, however, will be made by the
      30 OSS/OSA.) All notices should allow sufficient time prior to the opening of the
      operation window to allow clearance of the area by T-0.
      3.3.2. Make all hazard notification information available to the Mission Flight Control
      Officer (MFCO) (2 ROPS), Range Control Officer (2 ROPS/DOO), Program
      Management Support Section (2 ROPS/DOF), Range Operations Commander (ROC) (2
      ROPS/DOO), Base Operations (30 OSS/OSA), and 2 ROPS/DON to aid them in
      discharging their responsibilities, and to 30 SW/SEL for checking the accuracy of the
      hazard area coordinates.
      3.3.3. Notify the Union Pacific Manager Road Operations (MRO) of all operations
      (30SWI 13-207, Range Surveillance).
   3.4. The Aerospace Control Officer (ACO), in the Area Control Center (ACC),
   will: Ensure the track plots of all ships detected by radar surveillance in the local offshore
   area are displayed. This information, along with predicted positions for T-0, will be used by

     4.3.5. For R2534A/B, ensure a NOTAM request is sent to Los Angeles Air Route Traffic
     Control Center requesting the activation of this airspace for operations.
     4.3.6. Provide in a letter the following information to the Union-Pacific MRO ten
     working days before the original schedule date: Item number, operation number, window
     time, and mile post markers affected (Attachment 8).
     4.3.7. Provide 2 ROPS/DON with a copy of all operations hazard notices sent and make
     them available to 30 SW/SEL and other requesting agencies.
     4.3.8. Notify 30 OSS/OSA of airspace closure requirements.
  4.4. The Area Control Center will:
     4.4.1. During operations:
         4.4.1.1. At T-30 minutes, advise the ACO of any vessels that will be within an
         impact hazard area at planned liftoff (T-0) or T+7 minutes as appropriate. The ACO
         will, in turn, notify the ROC and the MFCO.
         4.4.1.2. When directed by the ACO, request maritime position information from the
         United States Coast Guard (USCG) Command Centers (CC), as appropriate, at Long
         Beach CA (DSN 360-7129) or Honolulu HI (DSN 421-4845).
     4.4.2. For Broadcast Notice to Mariners: Call the Port Control Offices (see Harbor
     Masters, Attachment 4) at L-1 day to verify the zones and vessel exclusion areas to be
     closed and the time of closure. Comply with security precautions in Paragraph 5 below.
     4.4.3. For ALTRV APVL (issued by FAA CARF Washington DC):
         4.4.3.1. At T-180 minutes, verify by telephone or voice page hotline that Oakland
         and Los Angeles Centers (as appropriate), have received ALTRV/NOTAM messages.
 6                                                            30SWI91-104 29 November 2011


           4.4.3.2. Notify the appropriate FAA centers of planned (realistic) T-60 milestones
           and update them as necessary to ensure air traffic reroute procedures are being
           enforced by the FAA.
           4.4.3.3. If an operation is scrubbed or rescheduled, notify the appropriate FAA
           Center (Oakland or Los Angeles) by voice page hotline as soon as possible. Also,
           advise the appropriate center of the “release” time after an operation is completed.
           Follow periods outlined in the MFCD-11, page 4.
     4.5. 30 OSS/OSA will: Issue a NOTAM indicating airfield closures for Range operations
     that affect R-2516 and airfield operations. Airfield closure times on the NOTAM will
     coincide with the Range closure times indicated in the ALTRV APREQ provided by 2
     ROPS/DOS. The NOTAM should state that aircraft may be turned away from Vandenberg
     AFB airspace during the closure time due to missile launch operations.
5. Security Precautions. The security requirements of some programs could be degraded by
following the above routine hazard notice procedures. The following special measures will be
considered and employed, as appropriate, in order to effectively promote the Commander’s
responsibility for security.
     5.1. 30 SW/SEL will:
        5.1.1. Perform a ship risk analysis and evaluate the degree of risk associated with each
        area normally defined in hazard notices.
        5.1.2. Coordinate with 30 SW/CCH to consider or implement one, or a combination, of
        the following procedures for issuing Operation Hazard Notices:
           5.1.2.1. Delete those notices pertaining to areas where the risk level is less than the
           predetermined hazard criteria. It is extremely unlikely that all hazard notices for an
           operation could be excluded due to predicted risk levels.
           5.1.2.2. Enlarge, skew, or distort the defined hazard area boundaries.
           5.1.2.3. Coordinate with 2 ROPS/DON and ensure message addressee lists are
           minimized to essential distribution and advanced time notification.
     5.2. 2 ROPS/DON will:
        5.2.1. Review the defined hazard area boundaries and coordinate with 2 ROPS/DOS to
        minimize to essential distribution and advance time notification
        5.2.2. Instruct the air controllers and surveillance monitors to make routine Danger Zone
        and ship exclusion box telephone calls to Harbor Masters and broadcast the notices to
        mariners.
        5.2.3. Instruct the Duty Air Controller and advise the ACO concerning any restricted use
        of radio and land line communications which are normally routine to operations.
     5.3. 2 ROPS/DOS will:
        5.3.1. Coordinate the subject message traffic for classified operations with 30 SW/SEL.
        Provide 30 SW/SEL, 2 ROPS/DO, 2 ROPS/DOF, and 2 ROPS/DON a copy of the
        message traffic.
30SWI91-104 29 November 2011                                                               7


     5.3.2. Prepare the subject messages for routine release. Activate Danger Zones as called
     for on page 4 of the Safety Data Letter (MFCD-11).
     5.3.3. Issue Broadcast Notice to Mariners.
     5.3.4. Advise 2 ROPS/DO concerning subject security precautions.
