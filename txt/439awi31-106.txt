     merely subject to deployment). (Deployers, weapon custodians, weapons couriers, etc.).

     Instructions or tasking Line Remarks will identify the need for live-fire weapons
     qualifications.
4                                                                439AWI31-106 24 MAY 2012

       a personnel process code will not receive weapons training prior to departing the
       Continental United States (CONUS.)

    weapons qualifications must remain current throughout the tour length without waiver.
    4.18. Deploying personnel must meet any applicable AOR site-specific Reporting
    Instructions for weapons qualifications requirements (including remaining live fire qualified
    throughout tour) for critical threat/contingency area they are tasked to support.
    4.19. If a person is within 120 days of separation, the unit commander can grant an extension
    of qualification.
    4.20. Remedial Training.
       4.20.1. Personnel who do not meet the minimum score for qualification will be
       scheduled for remedial training. A memorandum will be sent to the unit scheduler
       identifying the person. In addition, the individual will also receive a copy of the
       memorandum.
       4.20.2. The individual will return the following month Unit Training Assembly (UTA)
       for remedial training. If the individual cannot attend that training class, 439 SFS/S4C
       must be notified immediately.
       4.20.3. If the person is qualified on the day of training and does not meet the minimum
       score for qualification, 439 SFS/S4C may grant a 30-day extension. This extension is
       given so commanders have some flexibility in meeting arming requirements.

       training.
    4.21. Arming Requirements.

      4.22.2. At the annual schedulers meeting, 439 SFS/S4C must be provided with annual

      4.22.3. The information will be used to make out the Fiscal Year schedule and on reports
      that need to be sent to HQ AFRC and 439 SFS/S4C Fiscal Year and quarterly reports.

      information to ensure it is correct before finalizing the report.
