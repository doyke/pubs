1.1. Program Purpose. The Luke AFB corrections facility provides quality
confinement/corrections and rehabilitation services for pre-trial detainees and post-trial inmates
serving a courts-martial sentence. The Corrections Officer ensures a secure, humane and
productive environment for inmates and staff. The confinement staff will maintain a high level
of discipline and provide for the education, training, rehabilitation and welfare of offenders.
Those not retained for further military service will be given the opportunity to return to society
as a responsible and productive citizen. The confinement staff is committed to ensuring that
crime victims and witnesses are afforded all the rights and privileges to which they are entitled
under law. The Corrections Noncommissioned Officer (NCO) will strive to ensure all Victim
Witness Assistance Program (VWAP) requirements are met.
1.2.2.1. Florence Correctional Corporation of America (CCA), Florence, Arizona (AZ), has
been contracted for use when deemed necessary by the Corrections Officer. Florence CCA has
been approved for use by the US Marshals Service and authorized by the 56 FW/CC.

responsibility using Operation and Maintenance (O&M) funds. The Corrections NCO, upon
receiving the bill from Florence CCA, will contact the parent unit’s resource advisor to ensure
the bill is paid on time.
1.2.2.2.5.1. (Added) The parent unit will provide a vehicle and necessary escorts to transfer the
inmate to Florence CCA. The unit First Sergeant will account for and take control of the
inmate’s belongings prior to the transfer. The unit First Sergeant will provide the inmate with an
accountability listing for his/her belongings.
1.3.10. Inmate’s parent unit is responsible for their confined personnel, regardless of location,
until the member is formally gained into the Air Force Corrections System (AFCS), which
normally occurs upon receiving a sentence of 10 months or longer. This responsibility includes,
but is not limited to: providing escorts, assisting confined members’ families, visiting confined
members at least monthly, making telephonic contact when geographically separated and
obtaining transfer orders. Additionally, when inmates are scheduled for appointments (i.e.,
medical, dental, legal, etc.) and transfers, the inmates’ parent unit is responsible for security and
escorting the inmate to and from the appointment/transfer. All unit escorts will receive an escort
briefing by the Corrections NCO prior to being allowed to perform duties as an inmate escort.
2.3.1.8. Inmate Suicide Prevention Plan is described in further detail in Squadron Operating
Instruction (SOI) 31-1, Security and Law Enforcement Operations. The 56 SFS/S3T will
provide suicide prevention training pertaining to inmate confinement.
2.5.1. 56th Medical Group is responsible for disposition of laundry and linen used by or possibly
contaminated by HIV positive inmates IAW local policy.
3.2.6.4. If a Military Magistrate determines a detainee should be released from pre-trial
confinement, the detainee’s commander will be informed by Judge Advocate (56 FW/JA) of the
need to notify any potential victim or witness of the release.
3.2.8. 56 FW/JA will conduct VWAP training with corrections staff periodically.
AFI31-205_LUKEAFBSUP 2 JULY 2013                                                                  3


3.3. (Sex Offender Notification Program.) If a person is found guilty of any sexually violent
offenses or convicted of sex offenses against victims who were minors and does not receive
confinement as part of the conviction, 56 FW/JA is responsible for completing the registration
process. Security Forces Corrections will give guidance as needed, but forms must be filed with
the Report of Investigation and court documents.
4.7.5. The base chaplain (56 FW/HC) will provide adequate religious supplies and literature to
the corrections facility, and be available for counseling.
5.1.1. Unit representatives may order a person into pre-trial confinement only if designated in
writing by the unit commander. Designation letters will be kept on file at the corrections facility.
5.1.4. 56 FW/JA and the Area Defense Counsel (ADC) will provide legal services to inmates.
These services will be conducted in building 179. The corrections officer or designee is
authorized to make exceptions to this policy. Refer to AFI 31-205, paragraph 6.4.5.
5.1.4.1. (Added) Before an individual is placed into pre-trial confinement, 56 FW/JA will
complete a legal review to determine if the pre-trial confinement is legal.
5.3.2. 56 FW/JA will inform unit First Sergeants to contact the corrections facility prior to the
courts-martial. First Sergeants will ensure they have escorts trained and available prior to the
courts-martial. Within 24 hours after entry into confinement or next duty day for processing on
weekends or holidays (pre-trial and post-trial confinement) the unit First Sergeant will ensure a
medical examination has taken place. The examination, at a minimum, includes a medical and
behavioral health records review and physical examination. The examining official will use
Department of Defense (DD) Form 2707, Confinement Order, or locally generated form and will
annotate the presence of cuts, bruises, or unusual marks. Additionally, the medical officer will
test for communicable diseases, including HIV, Tuberculosis (TB) and Hepatitis B and conduct
urinalysis screening for illegal drug and narcotic use. The medical officer will also inspect all
body cavities to prevent the introduction of contraband into the facility. The DD Form 2707,
will be filed in the Correctional Treatment File (CTF) with all of the documented results, except
HIV results, which is annotated in the medical treatment file and discussed between the
examining official and confinement/corrections NCO. Female inmates will also be administered
a pregnancy test, with results annotated on the confinement order and in the medical treatment
record.
5.3.2.5. The inmate’s unit First Sergeant will ensure the Mental Health officer has advance
notice of the courts-martial time. The Mental Health officer will, upon initial entry into the
confinement facility, screen the inmate’s medical records for Mental Health consultation entries.
The (behavioral) Mental Health officer will determine if the inmate requires follow-on mental
health support, is a danger to self or others, or has difficulty adjusting to confinement and will
advise the corrections staff of the results.
5.4.1. 56th Medical Group will provide medical support and advice to pregnant inmates.
5.9.1.1. (Added) 56th Medical Group (56 MDG) agrees to the following provisions:
5.9.1.1.1. (Added) During duty hours, the Chief Nurse (SGN) or a predetermined nurse
assigned by the SGN will travel to the confinement facility to administer a controlled medication
to the inmate. In the event the SGN cannot be reached, SGN will designate a point of contact
(POC) who will then assign another nurse the duties to administer the controlled medications.

5.9.1.1.2. (Added) During non-duty hours, “on-call” nursing personnel will be made available
to respond to the confinement facility as needed to issue controlled substances to inmates; the 56
MDG SGN will provide an on-call listing of nursing personnel to the Confinement NCO based
on the projected days of confinement.
5.9.1.1.3. (Added) If the inmate is receiving a controlled medication the detainee has not
received previously, the nurse administering medications will remain 15 minutes after watching
the detainee take the medication to ensure no immediate adverse reaction.
5.9.1.2. (Added) 56th Security Forces Squadron (56 SFS) agrees to the following provisions:
5.9.1.2.1. (Added) Medications other than controlled substances can and will be administered
by security personnel trained by local medical authority. MDG personnel will be responsible for
training 56 SFS personnel annually on the safe administration of non-controlled medications and
on an “as needed” basis. The training will include a Medication Administration Test
(Attachment 25) and Competency Checklist (Attachment 26). Training will be provided by a
predetermined nurse assigned by the SGN. Documentation of the training will be annotated on
an AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training. Training is good for one
calendar year. Controlled items are identified by the prescription number starting with the
number “2” or “3”. The prescription numbers for all non-controlled substances start with the
number “5 or 6”.
5.9.1.2.2. (Added) A controlled item inventory will be conducted jointly each shift by 56 SFS
personnel, on-coming and off-going. The count will be verified with the medication log.
5.9.1.2.3. (Added) If a non-controlled medication error is made by the corrections staff
(medication given to the wrong inmate, two pills given instead of one, etc.), they should call the
provider who assessed the inmate or the provider’s nurse at the MDG, along with completing an
AF Form 1168, Statement of Suspect/Witness/Complainant. The statement will be routed
through 56 SFS and a redacted copy provided to 56 MDG.
5.9.1.2.4. (Added) When an inmate is transferred to another facility the scheduled medications
will not be taken with him/her, the medications will be destroyed by the inmate’s First Sergeant
and witnessed by 56 SFS/S3C according to the guidance of the US Food and Drug
Administration, Disposal of Unused Medicines located in paragraph 5.9.4.
5.9.1.2.5. (Added) Inmates will be escorted to the medical facility by Security Forces or an
authorized escort official IAW AFI 31-205. Escorts will be properly trained by the corrections
staff.
5.9.3.1. (Added) The Luke AFB Form 336 will be used to track inmate/detainee medication.
5.9.3.2. (Added) The medication nurse will document the inmate’s pain level on the Luke AFB
Form 336 prior to administration and then reassess the pain 30 minutes to 1 hour afterwards.
The medication nurse will sign the medication log noting the amount given and will sign the far
right column.
5.9.3.3. (Added) The medication nurse will count the number of controlled meds prior to any
administration and will confirm the amount with the on-duty Security Forces personnel. This
number should match the number on the Luke AFB Form 336.
5.9.3.4. (Added) Inmates who have a medical/surgical procedure performed at a civilian
facility must be escorted to the 56 MDG, within 24 hours following a procedure and preferably
AFI31-205_LUKEAFBSUP 2 JULY 2013                                                                  5


immediately following the procedure in order to be assessed by a provider. Inmates who are
empanelled at the 56 MDG will see their normal provider. Inmates who are not empanelled will
be seen by the duty provider on call for that evening.
5.9.3.4.1. (Added) Inmates should be booked against an acute appointment when possible or
an opened scheduled appointment. If neither exists, then the detainee must be worked in as a
“walk-in” patient.
5.9.3.4.2. (Added) In the event the inmate cannot travel to the 56 MDG following the
procedure, a 56 MDG provider will perform his/her assessment at the confinement facility using
the same time frame as stated above. The provider, upon return to the 56 MDG, will enter the
medications into AHLTA based on his/her clinical assessment. If controlled medications are
ordered for pain, a nurse will pick up the medications from the pharmacy, sign the Luke AFB
Form 336 along with the Pharmacy Staff, and then take the controlled medications to the
confinement facility. Upon arrival, the Corrections NCO will sign the Luke AFB Form 336
verifying the amount received matches the amount dispensed. (A total of three signatures will be
on the forms upper section.)
5.9.3.5. (Added) If the inmate is physically able to come to the 56 MDG, the dispensing 56
MDG pharmacy personnel will fill out and sign the Luke AFB Form 336 (in the Pharmacy
Signature block) along with documenting the beginning medication count. The Corrections
NCO or Unit Escort will also sign the form (Confinement/Escort Signature block) validating the
correct number of pills, prior to escorting the inmate back to the confinement facility. (A total of
two signatures will be in the fifth row). The Corrections NCO will lock up the controlled
medications upon arrival to the confinement facility.
5.9.4. (Added) Destroying Inmate Medication. If inmate medication needs to be destroyed, the
following process will be used. Take medication out of its original container and mix medication
with an inedible substance, such as used coffee grounds or kitty litter. Put medication in a
sealable bag, empty can, or other container to prevent the medication from leaking or breaking
out of a garbage bag. Before throwing out a medicine container, scratch out all identifying
information on the prescription label to make it unreadable.
6.1.1. If an inmate is in non-pay status, his/her unit will provide health and comfort items using
unit O&M funds. A list of health and comfort items can be obtained from the corrections
facility.
6.5.4. The installation chaplain will appoint a chaplain staff representative to provide
consultations and pastoral services to the inmate population. These services will take place in
building 179.
7.1. Clothing. Pre-trial detainees and post-trial inmates will wear the Airmen Battle Uniform
(ABU) uniform. Distinctive uniforms will only be authorized on a case-by-case basis for those
detainees/inmates posing a danger to the public or an escape risk and then only after MAJCOM
coordination and Headquarters (HQ) Air Force Security Forces Center (AFSFC)/SFC approval.
If approved pre-trial detainees will wear a white jumpsuit and post- trial inmates will wear an
orange jumpsuit. The distinctive uniform will be worn in the same manner as the ABU (bloused,
black or brown t-shirt, boots, and ABU hat).
7.1.3. The parent unit commander will ensure an inmate has all required clothing and equipment
(no more and no less) upon entry into confinement. The Luke AFB ADC office (regardless of
 6                                                    AFI31-205_LUKEAFBSUP 2 JULY 2013


who is assigned the case) will inform the unit First Sergeant of this requirement at least a week
prior to the courts-martial. All clothing items will be in serviceable condition. If the inmate is to
be transferred, the list will be modified to meet the requirements of the accepting facility. The
unit First Sergeant will take control of any additional or unauthorized items immediately.
8.2.6. Local area escorts. For local area escorts the parent unit commander and the Defense
Force Commander (DFC) will determine appropriate escort rank, which must be at least an E-5
(or GS equivalent) if a non-Security Forces (SF) escort is used. Security forces and parent units
must be careful not to assign escort duty to any person who may sympathize with the inmate
(i.e., a peer who previously worked with the inmate). Rank restrictions do not apply to security
forces personnel responsible for local area escorts or inmate security/control.
8.8.1.2.3. Anytime an inmate violates the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), local laws,
or facility rules, the corrections officer may direct a Discipline and Adjustment (D&A) board. If
determined a D&A board will be held, the inmate will receive 24-hour notice to prepare for the
board. The inmate is authorized legal advice within this 24-hour period; however his/her legal
representative will not be present at the board. If legal advice is requested, the ADC will consult
with the inmate within the 24-hour notice.
8.9.2. 56th Medical Group/Mental Health personnel will evaluate (in the corrections facility)
any inmate placed into segregation. This evaluation will be completed as soon as possible upon
notification not to exceed 24 hours. Medical personnel will inform the corrections officer of
their findings after each visit.
9.1.7.2. If an inmate is to be transferred to another facility and it is determined by Mental Health
or medical personnel that the inmate is mentally or medically unstable, the 56th Medical Group
will provide medical support to assist in the transfer. The cost associated with the transfer will
be the responsibility of the inmate’s parent unit.
11.3.3. (Added) Inmates may earn extra good conduct time IAW AFI 31-205. Good time will
be documented using Luke AFB Form 334, Earned Time Computation Sheet Luke AFB
Confinement.
11.5.1. All inmates are required by AFI 31-205 to receive at least 1 hour of physical training,
three times a week. This is usually conducted through a self-paced exercise program at the base
gym, and requires the parent unit escort the inmate and remain with him/her throughout their
exercise routine, maintaining constant eyesight of the inmate at all times. Physical training is
only conducted throughout the normal work week (Mon- Fri), and the parent unit must
coordinate their planned escort schedule with the Corrections NCO. All unit escorts will receive
an escort briefing by the Corrections NCO prior to being allowed to perform duties as an inmate
escort.
